Whoosh!&#x201d; Big machines, and their drivers, are the stars in this chanting, rhyming picture book that describes how a road is made, and then, once the tar is sealed, how it is made safe for travelers with painted lines, signs, and streetlamps. The words pound with the sound and rhythm of the vehicles they describe, and preschoolers will delight in shouting out the noisy exclamations (&#x201c;Whizz! Slop! Splurt!&#x201d;) that end each page. The large, clear print and basic vocabulary will extend the audience to new readers, who will also appreciate that the action described in the words is clearly illustrated in Lovelock&#x2019;s bright, uncluttered ink pictures of the glorious vehicles, their drivers (including a few women), and the community that enjoys the finished road. An easy sell to kids who love to watch machines at work, this will pair nicely with Kate and Jim McMullan&#x2019;s&nbsp;I Stink! (2002) and Kate Banks&#x2019; The Night Worker (2000).

Warren Berger revives the lost art of questioning</b><b>.</b></p><p>In this groundbreaking book, journalist and innovation expert Warren Berger shows that one of the most powerful forces for igniting change in business and in our daily lives is a simple, under-appreciated tool--one that has been available to us since childhood. Questioning<b>--</b>deeply, imaginatively, "beautifully"--can help us identify and solve problems, come up with game-changing ideas, and pursue fresh opportunities. So why are we often reluctant to ask "Why?"</p><p>Berger's surprising findings reveal that even though children start out asking hundreds of questions a day, questioning "falls off a cliff" as kids enter school. In an education and business culture devised to reward rote answers over challenging inquiry, questioning isn't encouraged--and, in fact, is sometimes barely tolerated.</p><p>And yet, as Berger shows, the most creative, successful people tend to be expert questioners. They've mastered the art of inquiry, raising questions no one else is asking--and finding powerful answers. The author takes us inside red-hot businesses like Google, Netflix, IDEO, and Airbnb to show how questioning is baked into their organizational DNA. He also shares inspiring stories of artists, teachers, entrepreneurs, basement tinkerers, and social activists who changed their lives and the world around them--by starting with a "beautiful question."</p></p><p><b>Warren Berger</b> has studied hundreds of the world's leading innovators, entrepreneurs, and creative thinkers to learn how they ask questions, generate original ideas, and solve problems. His writing and research on questioning and innovation has appeared in <i>Fast Company, Harvard Business Review, </i>and <i>Wired</i>. He is the author of <i>The Book of Beautiful Questions </i>and the internationally acclaimed book <i>Glimmer</i>, an in-depth analysis of creative thinking that was named one of Business Week's &#x201c;Best Innovation &amp; Design Books of the Year.&#x201d; Berger has appeared on NBC's "Today Show," ABC "World News," CNN, and NPR's "All Things Considered." He lives with his wife Laura E. Kelly in Westchester, New York. www.AMoreBeautifulQuestion.com.<p>"Questions have literally moved mountains, powered rockets, and instantly developed images . . . Berger focuses on what he calls &#x2018;Beautiful Questions&#x2019; . . . &#x2018;that can lead to game-changing answers and results. These are questions that, once raised, tend to get people thinking in a different way." &#x2015;Steven Heller, <i>The Atlantic</i></p><p>"A fascinating look at the power of questioning to ignite change--in our companies, schools, careers, and in our daily lives." &#x2015;<i>Huffington Post</i></p><p>"One closes Berger&#x2019;s book newly conscious of the significance of smart questions." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"We know that the art of asking questions is at the heart of discovery in science, philosophy, medicine--so why don&#x2019;t we extend that power to all areas of our lives? The thoughtful, provocative questions Warren Berger raises in this book are indeed the kind of 'beautiful questions' that can help us identify the right problems and generate creative solutions." &#x2015;Daniel Pink, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Drive</i> and <i>To Sell Is Human</i></p><p>"This potential game-changer will help readers identify where opportunities lie and how to seize them." &#x2015;<i>P</i><i> ublishers Weekly</i></p><p>"This thought-provoking book offers important insights." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"A practical testament to the significance of the questioning mind." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"In the old economy, it was all about having the answers. But in today&#x2019;s dynamic, lean economy, it&#x2019;s more about asking the right questions. <i>A More Beautiful Question</i> is about figuring out how to ask, and answer, the questions that can lead to new opportunities and growth." &#x2015;Eric Ries, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Lean Startup</i></p><p>"In this wise book, Warren Berger shows us how crucial it is to question every aspect of our lives, from business to school to our choice of toothpaste. My question: Why wouldn&#x2019;t you read this book?" &#x2015;A.J. Jacobs, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and <i>Esquire</i> columnist</p><p>"The genesis of many great startups is the simple question, 'Wouldn&#x2019;t it be cool if?' Warren Berger helps you understand the power of questions to change the world. Real men ask questions, they don&#x2019;t spout out answers." &#x2015;Guy Kawasaki, former chief evangelist at Apple and author of <i>Ape: Author,</i> <i>Publisher, Entrepreneur</i></p></p><h2>What Do You Do with a Tail Like This?</h2><p><p>A nose for digging?

Along with writing and illustrating children&#x2019;s books, Steve and Robin run a graphic design studio.*Starred Review* PreS-Gr. 2. Here's another exceptional cut-paper science book from Jenkins, this time put together with a partner, and like previous books, it's a stunner. An opening page, clearly explaining how to use the book, is followed by a double-page spread picturing the mouths of several different animals, accompanied by the question, "What do you do with a mouth like this?" The next spread shows each animal in full, explaining in a few simple words how the part functions. Tail, ears, nose, and eyes are covered in the same manner. A picture glossary at the back shows each animal again, postage-stamp size, with an informative note elaborating on the creature's special adaptation. The notes also neatly answer questions that might arise during a reading (Why <i>do</i> horned lizards squirt blood out their eyes?) and add to the interactive aspect of the book. A variety of animals is represented--some (elephant, hippo, chimp) will be comfortably familiar; others (four-eyed fish, blue-footed booby) are of interest because of their strangeness. Jenkins' handsome paper-cut collages are both lovely and anatomically informative, and their white background helps emphasize the particular feature, be it the bush baby's lustrous, liquid-brown eyes or the skunk's fuzzy tail. This is a striking, thoughtfully created book with intriguing facts made more memorable through dynamic art. <i>Tim Arnold</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

So the Harvey retired, until a group of friends decided to save it from the scrap heap. Then, one sunny September day in 2001, something so horrible happened that the whole world shook. And a call came from the fire department, asking if the Harvey could battle the roaring flames. In this inspiring true story, Maira Kalman brings a New York City icon to life and proves that old heroes never die.</p><p>In her own words: "born. bucolic childhood. culture-stuffed adolescence. played piano. stopped. danced. stopped. wrote. discarded writing. drew. reinstated writing. married Tibor Kalman and collaborated at iconoclastic yet successful design studio. wrote and painted children's books. worried. took up Ping-Pong. relaxed. wrote and painted for many magazines.&nbsp; cofounded the Rubber Band Society. amused. children: two. dog: one."1931 was a banner year in New York City. Accomplishments included the height of the new Empire State Building, the length of the George Washington Bridge, and the launching of the new fireboat John J. Harvey. In her signature book (an admirable candidate for the 2002 Caldecott Medal), Maira Kalman celebrates the feats of a hard-working boat and its crew in New York Harbor of the period and now, as the restored vessel begins a new life. Kalman also pays tribute to the role the Harvey played in the days of 9/11. Judd Hirsch narrates with admiration for each crew member. His voice is firm and steady as he shares both the mundane and the heroic. Sound effects of the period and the nautical and musical interludes complete the recording.

A war to rule Heaven and Earth that dates all the way back to the Garden of Eden. In the Garden, God told Satan that one day a woman would give birth to a male child &#x2013; the Messiah, who would redeem humanity and destroy him. In order to prevent this child&#x2019;s birth, Satan instigated a fallen angelic rebellion. A group of angels broke off their allegiance to the Lord and entered the earthly realm to corrupt the human gene pool and prevent the Savior&#x2019;s birth. These fallen angels (&#x201c;sons of God&#x201d;) took human wives (&#x201c;daughters of men&#x201d;) and had children with them. Their offspring &#x2013; hybrid half-human, half-angelic beings, were superhuman giants known as the Nephilim. With human DNA corrupted and humanity hanging in the balance, The Lord unleashed a punishment against the Nephilim so severe, only Noah and his family would survive. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>New Discoveries From Scripture Regarding The Nephilim And Their Fallen Angelic Ancestors </b></p><p></p> This is a comprehensive Biblical study of the Nephilim. Using a literal reading of Scripture, we are given a complete picture of the war between two bloodlines &#x2013; the lineage of the Messiah and the seed of Satan. Exploring passages rarely connected to the giants, you will discover new revelations regarding the Nephilim including:<p></p> <li>Why did Pharaoh order all male children to be thrown in the river and Herod execute all male children in Bethlehem?</li> <li>The Biblical location of the heavenly portal used by angels to enter the earthly realm.</li> <li>How were angels able to reproduce with human women?</li> <li>Who was the first human woman to marry the fallen Sons of God and conceive a child?</li> <li>Who was the fallen angel who ruled the preflood world?</li> <li>The specific timing and description of God&#x2019;s punishment of the rebel Sons of God and the Nephilim.</li> <li>How did the Nephilim return after the Flood and are there still Nephilim among us?</li> <strong>All these questions will be answered and many, many more. </strong> Citing dozens of ancient Christian and Jewish writings from the first century AD through the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, Judgment Of The Nephilim provides a thorough side-by-side comparison of the Bible and the extra-Biblical texts on this topic. It also details the connection between Genesis 6, Plato's account of Atlantis and ancient mythology. This book is a must-read for those who want to learn more on the topic of the Nephilim giants. This is the story of God&#x2019;s enduring love for all people and His promise to bring redemption through the prophesied Savior. <strong>This is the Judgment of the Nephilim.</strong> <p></p></p><p><b>RYAN PITTERSON</b> is a Biblical researcher and writer with an emphasis in ancient Hebrew thought and theology.

I have a read a handful of books on the topic and this is the most well-researched, easy to understand and most importantly - thoroughly Biblical work I have read to date. So well documented and follows a logical path with each chapter building on the previous chapter. Wow!&nbsp;<br><br>Some may see this topic as obscure, but it is 1000 times more relevant than most people realize. This book makes that clear and helps reveal that Genesis 6 has practical application for us today and it's directly linked to God's plan of redemption beginning with the prophecy in Genesis 3:15."<br>- <b>Todd Hampson, author of <i>The Non-Prophets Guide To The End Times</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Lailah&#39;s Lunchbox: A Ramadan Story</h2><p><p><strong><strong>*Notable Social Studies Trade Book For Young People 2016, a cooperative Project of the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) and the Children&#x2019;s Book Council*</strong><br><strong>*Featured Book of the Month, Anti-Defamation League*<br></strong><strong>*American Library Association Notable Book for Children 2016*</strong></strong></p><p><strong>*</strong><strong>Skipping Stones Honor 2016*</strong></p><p><strong>*International Literacy Association Choices Reading List*</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br> Lailah is in a new school in a new country, thousands of miles from her old home, and missing her old friends.

The evils of jealousy become clear in a nightmare in which a green-eyed monster convinces Sister to prove that she can ride the bike. But look out! Sister--and the bike--are headed for trouble.Stan and Jan Berenstain were both born in 1923 in Philadelphia.&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn't know each other as children, but met later at school, at the Philadelphia College of Art.&nbsp;&nbsp;They liked each other right away, and found out that the both enjoyed the same kinds of books, plays, music and art.&nbsp;&nbsp;During World War II, Stan was a medical assistant in the Army, and Jan worked in an airplane factory.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the war was over, they got married and began to work together as artists and writers, primarily drawing cartoons for popular magazines.&nbsp;&nbsp;After having their two sons Leo and Michael, the Berenstains decided to write some funny children's books that their children and other children could read and enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their first published children's book was called <b><i> The Big Honey Hunt </i></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about a family of bears, who later became known as the "Berenstain Bears".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Over 50 children's books later, Stan and Jan still plan all of their books together -- both write the stories, and both write the pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp;They live outside of Philadelphia in the country.</p><h2>I am Neil Armstrong (Ordinary People Change the World)</h2><p><b>Neil Armstrong's journey to the moon is the focus of the fifteenth picture book in the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling series of biographies about heroes.</b><br><br>This friendly, fun biography series focuses on the traits that made our heroes great--the traits that kids can aspire to in order to live heroically themselves.

Visit her on the Web at juliaalvarez.com.Tyler looks out the window of his bedroom and can&#x2019;t believe what he is seeing.<br> He rubs his eyes. Still there! Some strange people are coming out of the trailer where the hired help usually stays. They have brown skin and black hair, and although they don&#x2019;t wear feathers or carry tomahawks, they sure look like the American Indians in his history textbook last year in fifth grade.<br> Tyler rushes out of his room and down the stairs. In the den his father is doing his physical therapy exercises with Mom&#x2019;s help. The TV is turned on; Oprah is interviewing&nbsp;a lady who has come back from having died and is describ-ing how nice it is on the other side. &#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; Tyler gasps. &#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;What is it? What is it?&#x201d; Mom&#x2019;s hand is at her heart, as if it might tear out of her chest and fly away. <br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s some Indians trespassing! They just came out of the trailer!&#x201d; <br> Dad is scrambling up from the chair, where he has been lifting a weight Mom has strapped to his right leg. He lets himself fall back down and turns the TV to mute with the remote control. &#x201c; &#x2019;Sokay, boy, quiet down,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You want to kill your mom with a heart attack?&#x201d; <br> Before this summer, this might have been a joke to smile at. But not anymore. Mid-June, just as school was letting out, Gramps died of a heart attack while working in his&nbsp;garden. Then, a few weeks later, Dad almost died in a farm accident. Two men down and Tyler&#x2019;s older brother, Ben, leaving for college this fall. &#x201c;You do the math,&#x201d; his mom says whenever the topic comes up of how they can continue farming. Tyler has started thinking that maybe their farm is jinxed. How many bad things need to happen before a farm can be certified as a bad-luck farm? <br> &#x201c;But shouldn&#x2019;t we call the police? They&#x2019;re trespassing!&#x201d; Tyler knows his dad keeps his land posted, which means put-ting up signs telling people not to come on his property without permission. It&#x2019;s mostly to keep out hunters, who might mistakenly shoot a cow or, even worse, a person. <br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not exactly trespassing,&#x201d; his mom explains, and&nbsp;then she glances over at Dad, a look that means, You explain it, honey.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Son,&#x201d; his dad begins, &#x201c;while you were away . . .&#x201d;<br> In the middle of the summer, Tyler was sent away for a visit to his uncle and aunt in Boston. His mom was worried about him.<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just not himself,&#x201d; Tyler overheard Mom tell her sister, Roxanne, on the phone. &#x201c;Very mopey. He keeps having nightmares. . . .&#x201d; Tyler groaned. Nothing like having his feelings plastered out there for everyone to look at.&nbsp;<br> Of course Tyler was having nightmares! So many bad things had happened before the summer had even gotten started.&nbsp;<br> First, Gramps dying would have been bad enough. Then, Dad&#x2019;s horrible accident. Tyler actually saw it happen. Afterward, he couldn&#x2019;t stop playing the moment over and over in his head: the tractor climbing the hill, then doing this kind of weird backflip and pinning Dad underneath. Tyler would wake up screaming for help.&nbsp;<br> That day, Tyler rushed into the house and dialed 911. Otherwise, the paramedics said, his father would have died. Or maybe Dad would have been brought back to life to be on <i>Oprah </i>talking about the soft music and the bright lights.&nbsp;<br> It was amazing that Dad was still alive, even if it looked like his right arm would be forever useless and he&#x2019;d always&nbsp;walk with a limp. His face was often in a grimace from the pain he felt.<br> But the very worst part was after Dad got home and Tyler&#x2019;s parents seriously began to discuss selling the farm. Mostly, it was his mom. His dad hung his head like he knew she was right but he just couldn&#x2019;t bear to do the math one more time himself. &#x201c;Okay, okay,&#x201d; he finally said, giving up.<br> That was when Tyler lost it. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t sell it! You just can&#x2019;t!&#x201d;<br> He had grown up on this farm, as had his dad before him, and Gramps and his father and grandfather before that. If they left their home behind, it&#x2019;d be like the Trail of Tears Tyler learned about in history class last year. How the Cherokee Indians had been forced from their land to become migrants and march a thousand miles to the frontier. So many of them had died.<br> &#x201c;Tiger, honey, remember our talk,&#x201d; Mom reminded him pleasantly enough in front of Dad. Tiger is what his mom calls him when she is buttering him up. Before his father came home from the hospital, his right leg and arm still in a cast, Mom sat Tyler and his older brother and sister down for a talk. She explained that they must all do their part to help Dad in his recovery. No added worries (looking over at Ben, eighteen going on I&#x2019;m-old-enough-to-do-what-I-want). No scenes (looking over at Sara, fifteen with a boyfriend, Jake, and &#x201c;Saturday night fever&#x201d; seven nights a week, as his dad often joked, back when he used to joke). No commotion (looking over at Tyler, who as the youngest sometimes had&nbsp;to make a commotion just to be heard). They must all keep Dad&#x2019;s spirits up this summer.<br> But Tyler knew for a fact that selling the farm would kill his dad. It would kill Tyler!</p><h2>80 Morning Meeting Ideas for Grades 3-6</h2><p><p><strong>80 easy-to-do, classroom-tested ideas</strong> to help you plan engaging, purposeful Morning Meetings for third, fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students.

Flying over moonlit lands and sparkling seas, they encounter fantastic creatures, summon up surprising courage -- and cross the path of a ruthless villain with an ancient grudge who's determined to end their quest. Only a secret destiny can save the dragons in this enchanting adventure about the true meaning of home.</p><p>It's a fantasy, it's long, and it's got dragons in it. <i>Dragon Rider</i> is bound to be another hit book from Cornelia Funke! Ever since the popularity of bestselling fantasies <i>The Thief Lord</i> and <i>Inkheart</i> went global a few years ago, legions of fans have demanded more books from the German author than she can reasonably hope to write each year. So, re-discovering this hefty, earlier novel from 1997 was a logical development--and her keenest readers will devour it as before. <p> </p><p> Aimed at slightly younger readers than her previous novels, despite its massive five hundred pages, <i>Dragon Rider</i> is about a brave young dragon called Firedrake who embarks upon a dangerous journey to the Rim of Heaven in the Himalayas--a magical place where silver dragons can rest easy, free from the threat of destruction by mankind and their only hope of sanctuary. The key to its location is a map rendered by a rat who is a master cartographer.</p><p> Firedrake is joined on his quest by Ben, an orphaned boy, and Sorrell--a wise-cracking Brownie that is an odd, but ingenious, grumpy kind of fairy. Their journey is not a straightforward one by any means. Created by an alchemist called Petrosius Henbane in 1424, Nettlebrand (a malevolent creature covered in impenetrable gold plates) is their biggest threat--he is intent on destroying them. Nettlebrand is aided by Twigleg, a homunculus who has stowed away in Ben's bag and who is feeding reports on their progress back to his master.</p><p> </p><p> Their exciting encounters are many... It is easy to forgive the narrative's excessive length when readers are gorging on such a wonderfully inventive and readable story from an author who has her readers in the palm of her hand on every page.

Well, for at least the last 35-yrs. I&#x2019;m pretty sure my mom told me I was reading by age 4, and I&#x2019;ve always loved finding a great story to help me escape. Nothing allows the imagination to take root quite like a good story.

And I&#x2019;ve read a lot. This is one of them. Pearson&#x2019;s book is successful in the regional fiction arena, a la Pat Conroy and John Grisham. With some Lewis Grizzard thrown in. You can &#x201c;feel&#x201d; the area the story is set in, and you will relate to the characters he introduces, particularly if you&#x2019;re from coastal SC and GA. But here&#x2019;s the deal. The author has successfully woven an inspiring, relatable, serious and funny tale that makes you NEED to know the outcome. And probably the most successful part of this book is the humor.

She wrote a blog that called attention to what was happening in her beautiful corner of Pakistan and realized that words can bring about change. She has continued to speak out for the right of all children to have an education. In 2014 she won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>Dinah Brown is the author of<i> </i>several books for young readers.<b>Who Is Malala Yousafzai?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> When Malala Yousafzai (mah-LAH-lah yoo-sahf-ZIGH) was a little girl in Mingora, Pakistan, she decided to be a doctor when she grew up. She knew she would have to go to school for many years and study very hard. But Malala didn&#x2019;t mind at all. She loved everything about school. She loved reading. She loved history and geography and science. She loved studying religion. She enjoyed writing and reading stories aloud to her classmates.<br> &nbsp;<br> When her teacher talked about something new, she couldn&#x2019;t wait to learn more. Tests were difficult, but they were fun, too, especially when she had studied hard and knew the answers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, when Malala was ten years old, her life changed. War came to Mingora, the city where she lived. A group of violent fighters called the Taliban had taken over her beloved Swat Valley.<br> &nbsp;<br> They were saying that girls would soon be stopped from going to school. Not boys. Just girls.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taliban started destroying girls&#x2019; schools. The Pakistan Army arrived to stop them. Mingora became a war zone. It was very dangerous. People were afraid to go out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Malala wondered how she could ever become a doctor if she wasn&#x2019;t allowed to learn. She wished there was something she could do to help keep her school open. Many were closed, and few students dared to go to the ones that were open. But Malala went to school every day.<br> &nbsp;<br> Malala spoke out. She told local newspapers that she was afraid the Taliban would close her school. She talked about how frightening her life had become. She said that more than anything, she wanted to go to school.<br> &nbsp;<br> Malala was becoming famous. People were talking about her. Some Taliban fighters learned her name and decided to take revenge. On October 9, 2012, two of them stopped her school bus. One walked around to the back and looked inside. Then he shot Malala.<br> &nbsp;<br> Malala Yousafzai was lucky to survive. She was f lown to a hospital where she recovered.<br> &nbsp;<br> Did she stop speaking out? <br> &nbsp;<br> No.<br> &nbsp;<br> When she was better, she went on working for the right of all children to be educated. But she never stopped learning and studying and going to school.<br> &nbsp;<br> On July 12, 2013, she addressed hundreds of young people at the United Nations Youth Assembly in New York City. &#x201c;So here I stand, one girl among many,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I speak&#x2014;not for myself, but for all girls and boys. I raise up my voice&#x2014;not so that I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Malala Yousafzai wanted one thing&#x2014;an education. She spoke up, and people listened. Things began to change, little by little, until the whole world was listening.</p><h2>The First Thanksgiving (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)</h2><p><b>Celebrate Thanksgivings past and present with this Step into Reading Step 3 story that is perfect for beginning readers! </b><br><br> History comes to life on the page as readers learn the story of the Pilgrims hosting the first Thanksgiving.

The rocking of the deck beneath his feet made his stomach heave, and the wretched food they served him tasted even worse when retched back up. Besides, why did he need salt beef, hard cheese, and bread crawling with worms when he had wine to nourish him? It was red and sour, very strong. He sometimes heaved the wine up too, but there was always more. "The world is full of wine," he muttered in the dankness of his cabin. His father had never had any use for drunkards, but what did that matter? His father was dead. He ought to know; he'd killed him. A bolt in the belly, my lord, and all for you. If only I was better with a crossbow, I would have put it through that cock you made me with, you bloody bastard.<br><br> Below decks there was neither night nor day. Tyrion marked time by the comings and goings of the cabin boy who brought the meals he did not eat. The boy always brought a brush and bucket too, to clean up. "Is this Dornish wine?" Tyrion asked him once, as he pulled a stopper from a skin. "It reminds me of a certain snake I knew. A droll fellow, till a mountain fell on him."<br><br> The cabin boy did not answer. He was an ugly boy, though admittedly more comely than a certain dwarf with half a nose and a scar from eye to chin. "Have I offended you?" Tyrion asked the sullen, silent boy, as he was scrubbing. "Were you commanded not to talk to me? Or did some dwarf diddle your mother?"<br><br> That went unanswered too. This is pointless, he knew, but he must speak to someone or go mad, so he persisted. "Where are we sailing? Tell me that." Jaime had made mention of the Free Cities, but had never said which one. "Is it Braavos? Tyrosh? Myr?" Tyrion would sooner have gone to Dorne. Myrcella is older than Tommen, by Dornish law the Iron Throne is hers. I will help her claim her rights, as Prince Oberyn suggested.<br><br> Oberyn was dead, though, his head smashed to bloody ruin by the armored fist of Ser Gregor Clegane. And without the Red Viper to urge him on, would Doran Martell even consider such a chancy scheme? He may clap me in chains instead, and hand me back to my sweet sister. The Wall might be safer. Old Bear Mormont said the Night's Watch had need of men like Tyrion. Mormont may be dead, though. By now Slynt may be the Lord Commander. That butcher's son was not like to have forgotten who sent him to the Wall. Do I really want to spend the rest of my life eating salt beef and porridge with murderers and thieves? Not that the rest of his life would last very long. Janos Slynt would see to that.<br><br> The cabin boy wet his brush and scrubbed on manfully. "Have you ever visited the pleasure houses of Lys?" the dwarf inquired. "Might that be where whores go?" Tyrion could not seem to recall the Valyrian word for whore, and in any case it was too late. The boy tossed his brush back in his bucket and took his leave.<br><br> The wine has blurred my wits. He had learned to read High Valyrian at his maester's knee, though what they spoke in the Nine Free Cities... well, it was not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues. Tyrion had some Braavosi and a smattering of Myrish. In Tyrosh he should be able to curse the gods, call a man a cheat, and order up an ale, thanks to a sellsword he had once known at the Rock. At least in Dorne they spea the Common Tongue. Like Dornish food and Dornish law, Dornish speech was spiced with the flavors of the Rhoyne, but a man could comprehend it. Dorne, yes, Dorne for me. He crawled into his bunk, clutching that thought like a child with a doll.<br><br> Sleep had never come easily to Tyrion Lannister. Aboard that ship it seldom came at all, though from time to time he managed to drink sufficient wine to pass out for a while. At least he did not dream. He had dreamt enough for one small life. And of such follies: love, justice, friendship, glory. As well dream of being tall. It was all beyond his reach, Tyrion knew now. But he did not know where whores go.<br><br> "Wherever whores go," his father had said. His last words, and what words they were. The crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through the darkness with Varys at his side. He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon. He remembered none of it. Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father's bowels opening. Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me.<br><br> Varys had escorted him through the tunnels, but they never spoke until they emerged beside the Blackwater, where Tyrion had won a famous victory and lost a nose. That was when the dwarf turned to the eunuch and said, "I've killed my father," in the same tone a man might use to say, "I've stubbed my toe." The master of whisperers had been dressed as a begging brother, in a moth-eaten robe of brown roughspun with a cowl that shadowed his smooth fat cheeks and bald round head. "You should not have climbed that ladder," he said reproachfully.<br><br> "Wherever whores go." Tyrion warned his father not to say that word. If I had not loosed, he would have seen my threats were empty. He would have taken the crossbow from my hands, as once he took Tysha from my arms. He was rising when I killed him. "I killed Shae too," he confessed to Varys.<br><br> "You knew what she was."<br><br> "I did. But I never knew what he was."<br><br> Varys tittered. "And now you do."<br><br> I should have killed the eunuch as well. A little more blood on his hands, what would it matter? He could not say what had stayed his dagger. Not gratitude. Varys had saved him from a headsman's sword, but only because Jaime had compelled him. Jaime... no, better not to think of Jaime.<br><br> He found a fresh skin of wine instead, and sucked at it as if it were a woman's breast. The sour red ran down his chin and soaked through his soiled tunic, the same one he had been wearing in his cell. He sucked until the wine was gone. The deck was swaying beneath his feet, and when he tried to rise it lifted sideways and smashed him hard against a bulkhead. A storm, he realized, or else I am even drunker than I knew. He retched the wine up and lay in it a while, wondering if the ship would sink.<br><br> Is this your vengeance, Father? Have the Father Above made you his Hand? "Such are the wages of the kinslayer," he said as the wind howled outside. It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he had done, but when had the gods ever been fair? And around about then, the darkness gulped him down<br><br> When he stirred again, his head felt like to burst and the ship was spinning round in dizzy circles, though the captain was insisting that they'd come to port. Tyrion told him to be quiet, and kicked feebly as a huge bald sailor tucked him under one arm and carried him squirming to the hold, where an empty wine cask awaited him. It was a squat little cask, and a tight fit even for a dwarf. Tyrion pissed himself in his struggles, for all the good it did. He was up crammed face first into the cask with his knees pushed up against his ears. The stub of his nose itched horribly, but his arms were pinned so tightly that he could not reach to scratch it. A palanquin fit for a man of my stature, he thought as they hammered shut the lid and hoisted him up. He could hear voices shouting as he was jounced along. Every bounce cracked his head against the bottom of the cask. The world went round and round as the cask rolled downward, then stopped with a sudden crash that made him want to scream. Another cask slammed into his, and Tyrion bit his tongue.<br><br> That was the longest journey he had ever taken, though it could not have lasted more than half an hour. He was lifted and lowered, rolled and stacked, upended and righted and rolled again. Through the wooden staves he heard men shouting, and once a horse whickered nearby. His stunted legs began to cramp, and soon hurt so badly that he forgot the hammering in his head.<br><br> It ended as it had begun, with another roll that left him dizzy and more jouncing. Outside strange voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Someone started pounding on the top of the cask and the lid cracked open suddenly. Light came flooding in, and cool air as well. Tyrion gasped greedily and tried to stand, but only managed to knock the cask over sideways and spill himself out onto a hard-packed earthen floor.<br><br> Above him loomed a grotesque fat man with a forked yellow beard, holding a wooden mallet and an iron chisel. His bedrobe was large enough to serve as a tourney pavilion, but its loosely knotted belt had come undone, exposing a huge white belly and a pair of heavy breasts that sagged like sacks of suet covered with coarse yellow hair. He reminded Tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in the caverns under Casterly Rock.<br><br> The fat man looked down and smiled. "A drunken dwarf," he said, in the Common Tongue of Westeros.<br><br> "A rotting sea cow." Tyrion's mouth was full of blood. He spat it at the fat man's feet. They were in a long dim cellar with barrel-vaulted ceilings, its stone walls spotted with nitre. Casks of wine and ale surrounded them, more than enough drink to see a thirsty dwarf safely through the night. Or through a life.<br><br> "You are insolent. I like that in a dwarf." When the fat man laughed, his flesh bounced so vigorously that Tyrion was afraid he might fall and crush him. "Are you hungry, my little friend? Weary?"<br><br> "Thirsty." Tyrion struggled to his knees. "And filthy."<br><br> The fat man sniffed. "A bath first, just so. Then food and a soft bed, yes? My servants shall see to it." His host put the mallet and chisel aside. "My house is yours. Any friend of my friend across the water is a friend to Illyrio Mopatis, yes."<br><br> And any friend of Varys the Spider is someone I will trust just as far as I can throw him.<br><br> The fat man made good on the promised bath, at least... though no sooner did Tyrion lower himself into the hot water and close his eyes than he was fast asleep.<br><br> He woke naked on a goosedown featherbed so deep and soft it felt as if he were being swallowed by a cloud. His tongue was growing hair and his throat was raw, but his cock felt as hard as an iron bar. He rolled from the bed, found a chamberpot, and commenced to filling it, with a groan of pleasure.<br><br> The room was dim, but there were bars of yellow sunlight showing between the slats of the shutters. Tyrion shook the last drops off and waddled over patterned Myrish carpets as soft as new spring grass. Awkwardly he climbed the window seat and flung shudders open to see where Varys and the gods had sent him.<br><br> Beneath his window six cherry trees stood sentinel around a marble pool, their slender branches bare and brown. A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo's blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.<br><br> Across the pool stood stood a brick wall twelve feet high, with iron spikes along its top. Beyond that was the city. A sea of tiled rooftops crowded close around a bay. He saw square brick towers, a great red temple, a distant manse upon a hill. In the far distance sunlight shimmered off deep water. Fishing boats were moving across the bay, their sails rippling in the wind, and he could see the masts of larger ships poking up along the bay shore. Surely one is bound for Dorne, or for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. He had no means to pay for passage, though, nor was he made to pull an oar. I suppose I could sign on as a cabin boy and earn my way by letting the crew bugger me up and down the narrow sea. He wondered where he was. Even the air smells different here. Strange spices scented the chilly autumn wind, and he could hear faint cries drifting over the wall from the streets beyond. It sounded something like Valyrian, but he did not recognize more than one word in five. Not Braavos, he concluded, nor Tyrosh. Those bare branches and the chill in the air argued against Lys and Myr and Volantis as well.<br><br> When he heard the door opening behind him, Tyrion turned to confront his fat host. "This is Pentos, yes?"<br><br> "Just so. Where else?"<br><br> Pentos. Well, it was not King's Landing, that much could be said for it. "Where do whores go?" he heard himself ask.<br><br> "Whores are found in brothels here, as in Westeros. You will have no need of such, my little friend. Choose from among my serving women. None will dare refuse you."<br><br> "Slaves?" the dwarf asked pointedly.<br><br> The fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion fond remarkably obscene. "Slavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on us a hundred years ago. Still, they will not refuse you." Illyrio gave a ponderous half-bow. "But now my little friend must excuse me. I have the honor to be a magister of this great city, and the prince has summoned us to session." He smiled, showing a mouth full of crooked yellow teeth. "Explore the manse and grounds as you like, but on no account stray beyond the walls. It is best that no man knows that you were here."<br><br> "Were? Have I gone somewhere?"<br><br> "Time enough to speak of that this evening. My little friend and I shall eat and drink and make great plans, yes?"<br><br> "Yes, my fat friend," Tyrion replied. He thinks to use me for his profit. It was all profit with the merchant princes of the Free Cities. "Spice soldiers and cheese lords," his lord father called them, with contempt. Should a day ever dawn when Illyrio Mopatis saw more profit in a dead dwarf than a live one, he would find himself packed into another wine cask by dusk. It would be well if I were gone before that day arrives. That it would arrive he did not doubt; Cersei was not like to forget him, and even Jaime might be vexed to find a quarrel in Father's belly.<br><br> A light wind was riffling the waters of the pool below, all around the naked swordsman. It reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he helped his father's guardsmen rape her. He had been thinking of those guardsmen during his flight, trying to recall how many there had been. You would think he might remember that, but no. A dozen? A score? A hundred? He could not say. They had all been grown men, tall and strong... though all men were tall to a dwarf of thirteen years. Tysha knew their number. Each of them had given her a silver stag, so she would only need to count the coins. A silver for each and a gold for me. His father had insisted that he pay her too. A Lannister always pays his debts.<br><br> "Wherever whores go," he heard Lord Tywin say once more, and once more the bowstring thrummed.<br><br> The magister had invited him to explore the manse. He found clean clothes in a cedar chest inlaid with lapis and mother-of-pearl. The clothes had been made for a small boy, he realized as he struggled into them. The fabrics were rich enough, if a little musty, but the cut was too long in the legs and too short in the arms, with a collar that would have turned his face as black as Joffrey's had he somehow contrived to get it fastened. At least they do not stink of vomit.<br><br> Tyrion began his explorations with the kitchen, where two fat women and a pot boy watched him warily as he helped himself to cheese, bread, and figs. "Good morrow to you, fair ladies," he said with a bow. "Do you perchance know where the w...</p><h2>Between Two Worlds: Lessons from the Other Side</h2><p><b>From Tyler Henry, clairvoyant and star of E!&#x2019;s hit reality series <i>Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry</i>, comes <i>Between Two Worlds</i>, a captivating memoir about his journey as a medium thus far.</b><br><br>&#x201c;Dying doesn&#x2019;t mean having to say goodbye.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tyler Henry discovered his gift for communicating with the departed when he was just ten years old. After experiencing a sudden, accurate premonition of his grandmother&#x2019;s death&#x2014;what Tyler would later describe as his first experience of &#x201c;knowingness&#x201d;&#x2014;life would never be the same. Now in his twenties, Tyler is a renowned, practicing medium, star of the smash hit E! reality show, <i>Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry</i>, and go-to clairvoyant of celebrities, VIP&#x2019;s, and those simply looking for closure and healing. He has worked with some of Hollywood&#x2019;s biggest names including Khloe Kardashian, Amber Rose, Margaret Cho, Jaime Pressly, and Monica Potter.<br> <br>Despite struggling to accept his rare talent, Tyler grew to embrace it, and finally found the courage to share it with&#x2014;and ultimately change&#x2014;the world. For the first time, Tyler pulls back the curtain on living life as a medium in his first memoir, in which he fearlessly opens up about discovering his gift as an adolescent, what it&#x2019;s truly like to communicate with those who have passed, the power of symbolism in his readings, and the lessons we can learn from our departed loved ones. With unparalleled honesty, Tyler discusses how his complex and fascinating gift has changed his perception of the afterlife, and more importantly, how readings can impact our relationships with our closest friends and family once they&#x2019;re gone.</p><p>Tyler Henry is a practicing medium, and the star of E!&#x2019;s newest breakout reality show, <i>Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry</i>. A native of central California, he now resides in Los Angeles.Between Two Worlds Introduction<p></p> <br>More than ever, people are coming forward and sharing their experiences with after-death communication. Through television and film, the question of whether life exists beyond death has captivated our popular culture&#x2014;not because it&#x2019;s a new question, but because people are opening their minds to new answers. When I first got the call that my television show, Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry, had been green-lighted, I promised to make it my purpose to explore whatever answers came my way and to share them honestly with the world. That&#x2019;s the mission I&#x2019;m still on, and my own questions multiply by the day. With all the different opinions about mediumship and psychic phenomena in circulation, I aim to provide unique, easy-to-understand explanations, obtained through my firsthand experiences.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a firm believer that people should be able to decide for themselves what resonates with them. I&#x2019;ll share what I&#x2019;ve learned through communicating with the other side, and I encourage you to take from it what resonates with you. When it comes to the hereafter&#x2014;things aren&#x2019;t black or white. Taking into account the gray areas in between, I&#x2019;ll explain some of the more consistent dynamics I&#x2019;ve observed over the course of&nbsp;more than a thousand readings. There are many exceptions to the rules, but that&#x2019;s the beauty of the other side. It&#x2019;s far more complex and nuanced than anything we as humans can comprehend. There are some big questions to which I may never have the answers. However, every small answer helps contribute to our understanding of a much larger question: what happens when we die?<br> <br>I speak to dead people. More interestingly, the dead speak back to me&#x2014;primarily through sending mental impressions and sensations from the other side. All of what I do revolves around validation&#x2014;that is, getting the confirmation from the sitter that the information I&#x2019;m receiving is accurate and could only be known by the communicating spirit. Upon validation, my client gets the knowledge that their loved one&#x2019;s soul continues on, is at peace, and is able to communicate anything that had been left unsaid or that was realized during the transitioning process.<br> <br>If there&#x2019;s anything I&#x2019;ve learned through my work, it&#x2019;s that in life, diversity is a gift. I know many different kinds of people will be drawn to this book, from all different backgrounds, belief systems, and degrees of familiarity with the subject matter. In the following pages, I&#x2019;ll share with you my spiritual beliefs. However, I think it&#x2019;s more important for you to understand the process of exactly what happens when a spirit comes through. For that reason, I&#x2019;ll focus on the details of the experiences, so you can draw your own conclusions about how it all fits into the big picture of your beliefs. Individual differences aside, I think we can agree that we all benefit from the healing of others and the idea that love is eternal. The goal of my work, and the work of many other authentic mediums, is to reinforce these universal truths.<br> <br>I understand that my ability is a gift and not something for which I can take any credit. I&#x2019;m just a conduit for information to come through and reach those who are open to hearing it&#x2014;something we all have a natural ability to do, to varying degrees. Practice breeds consistency, and the more we develop and trust in our gut feelings, the more significantly and accurately our intuition can help us. Even after doing countless readings, I still have to remind myself daily to &#x201c;get out of my own way&#x201d; and allow myself to be a clear vessel through which messages can flow.<br> <br>When I first started learning about my abilities, I spent endless hours at bookstores and libraries, reading multiple books a day, and searching the Internet for resources and information about what made me so different. Being the only one experiencing an entirely other world was alienating in the truest sense. I felt like I had one foot in this world and one in the next. I didn&#x2019;t understand, nor did I feel understood by, either side. As a kid, learning the ropes to our earthly dimension was challenging enough, let alone throwing another one into the mix. I was somewhere in between, a messenger in the middle of two realms: a medium.<br> <br>Throughout my life, I&#x2019;ve come to understand the world in two ways. In one sense, I&#x2019;m like any other twenty-year-old adjusting to adulthood, learning to live on my own (and use a dishwasher for the first time, admittedly). Yet in a very different sense, the part of me that most people see is Tyler Henry the medium&#x2014;the Macaulay Culkin look-alike who gets in touch with celebrities&#x2019; dead loved ones on television. Though most people can&#x2019;t relate to what it&#x2019;s like to get visual, sensorial, and mental impressions from people who&#x2019;ve passed away, everyone is capable of understanding the impact those messages have on the loved ones who need it most. Whether it&#x2019;s a reference to pink fuzzy dice from your aunt Edna, or an inside joke shared with a beloved grandmother, these are the messages I strive to deliver&#x2014;no matter how random they may seem to me, personally.<br> <br>When my clients come for a reading, I view my connecting process as a bit of a puzzle to solve. I receive impressions from one or more spirits, and together, the querent and I establish how the message is relevant and where it connects. Readings are 50 percent receiving the information and 50 percent untangling it. Throughout the past few years of doing sessions, I&#x2019;ve seen countless forms of healing result from validating messages. Whether it&#x2019;s closure from a loved one, much-needed proof of a hunch, or a release of guilt, I&#x2019;ve been able to see what makes the most life-changing differences in each after-death communication. With each contact I make, I aim to bring a loved one through so clearly that it&#x2019;s undoubtable to my client that I&#x2019;m connecting. This validation comes from describing personality traits, quirks, family traditions, inside references, and sometimes even physical mannerisms. It&#x2019;s the small, but specific, details that communicate the essence of who someone is in life, and the same can be true for those on the other side.<br> <br>Every day brings new experiences and new stories shared by souls that are able to understand what truly mattered in their lives. Their messages teach us what we should value in our own. Above all, I&#x2019;ve learned that transitioning to the other side gives perspective. Ironically enough, it&#x2019;s the dead who have the most to teach us about life.<br> <br>In this book, I hope to provide the reader with a narrative unlike any other&#x2014;one that&#x2019;s honest, down-to-earth, and uses terms everyone can understand. Besides answering some frequently asked questions, I want to delve into all areas of my human experience&#x2014;as well as those of the individuals, living and dead, whose paths I&#x2019;ve crossed.</p><h2>Warriors: The New Prophecy #2: Moonrise</h2><p><p><strong>Erin Hunter&#x2019;s #1 nationally bestselling Warriors series continues with the second book in the New Prophecy series!</strong></p><p>The second book in this second series,&nbsp;<em>Warriors: The New Prophecy #2: Moonrise,</em>&nbsp;brings more adventure, intrigue, and thrilling battles to the epic world of the warrior Clans.</p><p>Moons have passed since six cats set out on a journey to save their Clans.

Froggy doesn't realize she has friends, until the Turtles join them, etc. Watercolor, ink, and gouache illustrations are well-designed to expand the text, using each animal's expressions and body language to convey their individual roles. Front and back end pages both act as maps of the river, but also provide an introduction and an epilogue to the tale. A dramatic spread, positioned from the animals' point of view, shows them on the edge of a precipice about to take the plunge. A page turn shifts to a facing view and all the creatures' wide-eyed expressions. One more turn pulls the focus out to long range, showcasing the river, the drop, and the animals perched precariously. As they fall, however, their expressions are mostly cheerful, then exuberant, ending with "Oh, what a ride!"

"What should I pray for?" they may wonder. "How should I pray?" "What if my mind wanders?" "What if I get stuck praying the same thing every day?"</p> <p>When asked by his barber and good friend Peter Beskendorf for some practical guidance on how to pray, Martin Luther responded by writing this brief treatise, first published in 1535. This edition is a modern translation that brings us Luther's practical instruction, using his ITCP method:</p> <p>1. Instruction<br>2. Thanksgiving<br>3. Confession<br>4. Prayer</p> <p>This method anchors prayer in the catechism or other biblical texts, but allows the Holy Spirit to prompt thoughts via the Word, which may be chased more freely by the mind at prayer. Readers will find their prayer lives refreshed and invigorated as they become more comfortable raising supplications to God.</p> <p>Useful for pastors to buy in bulk and give to members after pastoral care, confirmation, or joining the church.</p></p><p></p><h2>I Believe in Santa Claus</h2><p>Finally, a book that says it&#39;s OK to believe in Santa Claus, yet shows how this time honored symbol is meant to remind us of the true meaning of Christmas.</p><p>Diane G.

It was a wall that kept growing and growing. But its construction came at a huge cost: it is believed that more than a million Chinese died building it, earning the wall its nickname--the longest cemetery on earth. Through the story of the wall, Patricia Brennan Demuth is able to tell the story of China itself, the rise and fall of dynasties, the greatness of its culture, and its present-day status as a Communist world power.</p><p>Patricia Brennan Demuth is the author of <i>What Was Ellis Island?</i>, <i>What Was Pearl Harbor?</i>, <i>Who Was Laura Ingalls Wilder?</i>, and <i>Who Is Bill Gates?</i><p><b>Where Is the Great Wall?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> More than two thousand years ago, the emperor of China had workers start building a wall. It was a wall like no other on earth&#x2014;then or now. It has earned its name: the Great Wall. It is the largest structure that humans have ever made!<br> &nbsp;<br> It is impossible to give its exact length. That&#x2019;s because the Great Wall wasn&#x2019;t built at one time. It&#x2019;s a series of walls constructed over two thousand years, starting in ancient times. Emperors built new walls and linked them to old ones. Some walls decayed and fell apart. But the last Great Wall, built from about 1400 to 1600, still stands. It stretches in an unbroken line four thousand miles across China&#x2019;s northern border. If placed in North America, the main wall would reach from the tip of Florida to the North Pole.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> There are also side walls that reach down into China to protect and enclose important places. Altogether, estimates of the Great Wall&#x2019;s length range from about six thousand miles to over ten thousand miles. By any measure, it&#x2019;s huge!<br> &nbsp;<br> Many compare the Great Wall to a dragon, a symbol of power and strength in China. The head of the wall starts about sixty-six feet offshore, in the Pacific Ocean on China&#x2019;s east coast. Then it twists and turns through the land&#x2014;skirting rivers, crossing grasslands and plains, climbing steep mountains, and plunging down cliffs. Finally it ends in the harsh, dry desert on China&#x2019;s western end.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This amazing feat of engineering was <i>handmade!</i> There were no machines or power tools to help builders&#x2014;no forklifts, tractors, drills, or cement mixers. There were just human hands using tools made of stone, iron, and wood. The wall ended up taking a terrible human toll. It is believed that a million Chinese died while building it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today the Great Wall awes visitors from all over the world. The story of China itself is told in its bricks, dirt, and stone.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b>: <b>A Reason for Walls</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s been said that China is a land of walls within walls within walls. The ancient Chinese wanted something big and solid to keep out their enemies. So they built walls around their houses, temples, and cities. Wall building is as ancient as China itself. Almost.<br> &nbsp;<br> Long before the first walls were built, China was a land of nomads. The earliest people roamed from place to place hunting game. Then, about six thousand years ago, the Chinese began to farm. They built homes, tamed animals, and planted crops. Their land was perfect for agriculture. Rich soil filled its plains. Plenty of rain fell. And three giant rivers&#x2014;the Wei, Yangtze, and Huang He&#x2014;drained the land.<br> &nbsp;<br> Farming led to a settled way of life. Fathers worked the same small plots of land all their lives, then passed the land to their sons. Set routines were followed year after year. Farmers planted in the spring and tilled in the summer. In the fall, they stored large amounts of grain to last them through cold winters.<br> &nbsp;<br> With plenty to eat and safe shelter, the Chinese thrived. Their culture became highly advanced&#x2014;way ahead of other countries. A written language was developed in China as early as 2200 BC. Learned men started to write China&#x2019;s history on bamboo scrolls and stone. Meanwhile other lands still relied on oral storytelling.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Artists created beautiful paintings. Craftsmen made statues and containers out of polished bronze. Wise men, such as Confucius, set down their teachings. And women wove soft silk cloth. In time, Chinese silks would be prized around the world.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Life flowed smoothly in ancient China&#x2014;<i>except</i> for enemy attacks from the north. Tribes on horseback roamed the vast grasslands north of China, called the steppe. They were fearsome warriors. The people of China called the tribes by just one name: barbarians!&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Though the barbarians were neighbors with the Chinese, they couldn&#x2019;t have been more different. They lived in round tents called yurts. In place of silks, they wore animal skins. The nomads, who couldn&#x2019;t read or write, drank horse milk and ate cheese, things the Chinese looked down on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Land on the steppe was much too dry for farming. So the nomads hunted the wild animals that grazed on the grass. They also raised large herds of goats and sheep. When grass grew thin in one place, they packed up their few belongings and moved to the next.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The key to the nomads&#x2019; way of life was the horse. Indeed, they were the first people in the world to tame horses. Steppe children rode horseback almost as soon as they could walk.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The nomads looked with envy at their wealthy neighbors to the south. China had plenty of grain and metal&#x2014;things that didn&#x2019;t exist on the steppe. The Chinese refused to trade with barbarians. So the nomads stole what they needed instead. In the fall, when the harvest was at its peak, warriors armed with bows and arrows swept down into China. Sometimes small bands of armies raided. Other times, it was just a few hungry horsemen.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Their power lay in surprise attacks&#x2014;hit and run. Horsemen stormed into farms and villages, shooting with deadly aim while galloping at full speed. They took whatever they could get. Then, in a flash, they disappeared back to the steppe. They left behind ruined villages and many dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> How could the Chinese protect themselves? Conquering the nomads was impossible. There were too many small tribes. They were scattered all over the steppe and always on the move. The Chinese fell upon a simple answer: they would build walls.<br><br></p></p><h2>A Squiggly Story</h2><p>A young boy wants to write a story, just like his big sister. But there's a problem, he tells her. Though he knows his letters, he doesn't know many words. ?Every story starts with a single word and every word starts with a single letter,? his sister explains patiently. ?Why don't you start there, with a letter?? So the boy tries. He writes a letter. An easy letter. The letter I. And from that one skinny letter, the story grows, and the little boy discovers that all of us, including him, have what we need to write our own perfect story. <br><br>This picture book from award-winning author Andrew Larsen playfully and imaginatively explores a young child's process of learning to express himself. It promotes the idea that stories are available for everyone to tell, whatever way we can, and will inspire pre-readers to try writing stories of their own. The lively, fun illustrations by Mike Lowery incorporate story panels with dialogue bubbles, adding visual texture. Also helpful, the boy's story is shown both as he actually writes it --- with just a few letters, some punctuation marks and typographical symbols --- and as he imagines it. Celebrating self-expression, self-discovery and imagination, this book would enhance an early language arts lesson on writing, particularly on the parts of a story. It beautifully highlights the exciting worlds that are opened up when children begin to read and write. In a sweet touch, the boy and his sister model a close and supportive sibling relationship.</p><p>Andrew Larsen is the acclaimed author of such books as Goodnight, Hockey Fans, A Squiggly Story, The Not-So-Faraway Adventure, In the Tree House and The Imaginary Garden. He lives in Toronto, Ontario.<p>Mike Lowery has illustrated many books for children, including The Day My Mom Came to Kindergarten and A Squiggly Story. Mike lives in Decatur, Georgia.</p>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;What happens when you have a story but you're not sure how to write it down? Larsen introduces a boy as he struggles to write a story, even though his sister tells him it's easy. The feeling of frustration at not being able to form letters, the excitement of reading a story aloud to the class, and the just-a-little-bit bossy older sister will all be relatable elements to young readers. Because the book shows the boy employing several real-life strategies for prewriters, like starting to write with well-known letters and drawing pictures in place of words where the letters are unknown, this is especially recommended for school library collections. Teachers may find it can be used as a model text during writing units for preschool and kindergarten. The title is illustrated in a graphic novel-style, with speech bubbles and boxes for different images on some pages. The palette of greens, beiges, pinks, yellows, and blues is cool, and the simply drawn cartoon characters are stylized but expressive. The boy and his sister and the students in the boy's class are illustrated with a wide variety of skin tones, giving this volume an inclusive feel.

Farmer Nuthatcher's chickens are tired of their regular feed, and it just so happens that the rooster has been watching cooking shows over the farmer's wife's shoulder. He has some ideas, beginning with chips and salsa. Soon the ducks are inspired and give up fish for guacamole, and the pigs go for beans and chiles. With all of this southwestern cuisine, it's time for a fiesta. It turns out, though, that Mrs. Nuthatcher is making tamales, and all of the ingredients the animals need are gone, so it's time for a new cuisine&#x2013;from a French cookbook. This story is a fun read, with a refrain and a smooth pattern. Bogan's humorous illustrations keep the action moving, and the pages are filled with saturated color and energy. A definite purchase for any library.<i>&#x2013;Susan E. Murray, Glendale Public Library, AZ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

New York City has many hot restaurants at any given time, but back then, none was hotter than Il Mulino. It was and still is a place where the city&#x2019;s most powerful and influential people go to make deals, to celebrate, and to eat really well; it was rated the number one Italian restaurant by Zagat for twenty years in a row. Limousines were lined up for blocks every night, waiting for patrons inside. Among other things, Il Mulino was known for their impossible-to-get reservations, their high-profile clientele, their enormous portions, and their stuffed veal chop. Il Mulino was the most prestigious restaurant to sell veal to in the city, so it was important that we get it right in terms of getting them exactly what they wanted: milk-fed veal where the meat was very white, and with a large loin or &#x201c;eye&#x201d; muscle. The eye is the muscle that makes up a substantial portion of the chop, and since Il Mulino was charging an astronomical price for theirs, it had to be big, and it had to be perfect.<br> <br>Around the time I came on board, one of Il Mulino&#x2019;s owners, Gino Masci, began complaining that he wanted better veal than what we were giving him. There were no two more demanding people in the industry than Gino and Fernando, his brother and business partner. We respected the fact that they were as discerning as they were, and when they asked for something, we did it. We wanted to meet their request for veal, but there wasn&#x2019;t a lot we could do because we were limited to whatever was offered by either of the two veal suppliers at the 14th Street Meat Market.<br> <br>At the time, the way the meat business worked was that butchers like us would go to the 14th Street Meat Market where there were various brokers from whom we bought meat. My dad and I would get in a van and fight our way through traffic to get to the veal and the lamb suppliers first, then beef, then pork, and then poultry. We&#x2019;d pick up all of what we needed for that day, and then head back to our shop to cut it.<br> <br>But Il Mulino was an account we could not afford to lose. My dad and I had to really think about what we could do, and we decided to go on a spying mission. There was one veal house in particular where we were getting our best veal. The next time we got a delivery from them, we looked on the box for the USDA number of the meat processor who had delivered it. Every meat processor in the country has a USDA number that identifies them, and every meat delivery is required to have that number on it. There was no Google back then, but we had a yellow pages&#x2013;size USDA directory and we were able to take the numbers off that box and look up the source of the veal. It turned out the veal was coming from a processor located in New Jersey. The very next day my dad and I jumped in the car and drove out there. We just showed up and introduced ourselves. We told them we were butchers, that we supplied restaurants in Manhattan, and that we&#x2019;d like to start buying from them directly. We assured them we would pay all our bills within seven days. In our business, credit is everything&#x2014;if you can&#x2019;t pay your bills, you can&#x2019;t get product, and if you can and do pay your bills, there&#x2019;s a lot of power in that. We also promised them exclusivity: We would buy only from them, and in return, we wanted their best product. We already knew this veal to be very good because we had been buying it through a distributor; we just wanted to know that we would get the cream of the crop. We asked for the top 10 percent they had to offer. And we had a deal. Once we made that agreement, we went downstairs into the processing facility where the calves were being split. Just as a precautionary measure, to make sure we really did get the cream, my dad pulled aside one of the gentlemen who oversaw the production line, slipped him an envelope containing $500, and told him, &#x201c;I need the best veal coming off the line.&#x201d; When my father and I went back to New York, we gave two days&#x2019; notice to our veal purveyor and began getting our deliveries straight from this processor.<br><br> <br>Il Mulino on West Third Street in the Village is still an institution.<br><br>Cutting out the middleman and going directly to the source was a very significant change for us. It wasn&#x2019;t about saving money; if we saved anything, it would have been pennies, and in more instances, we paid more for our product because even though we had the first right to it, we were still bidding against other meat companies to get the best available. What was important was that we now had control over the quality of the veal we were buying. Veal was just the first meat we did this with. Today, we don&#x2019;t use any middlemen; we get all of our meat directly from the grower. This is how we completely changed the way meat had been brokered up until that point in New York City, and also the way my dad had been buying meat since he was a twelve-year-old boy.<br> <br>When the truck with our first delivery pulled up in front of our plant on Leroy Street, it was a truly exciting moment. We now had something none of our competitors had&#x2014;a direct line to the source, and a promise to offer the best there was to be had. We were very proud of what we had done. We knew it was going to change the way we did business, and it did.<br> <br>Because we had Il Mulino as a loyal customer, we were now the go-to guys for veal. Every chef with a good restaurant in New York City wanted to buy veal from us. Back then veal was very, very popular. The demand has diminished since then, but in the 1990s, veal was what set a restaurant apart. And it&#x2019;s how we relaunched our identity.<br> <br>To give you an idea of how small we still were at that time, my mother used to do all of our marketing, which consisted of her walking into restaurants in Greenwich Village and giving them our business card or a T-shirt. My mother had dropped a card at P�, a tiny place on Cornelia Street owned by Mario Batali. This was before Mario was &#x201c;Molto Mario,&#x201d; and before he was a household name. I had never heard of the guy until the day he called asking for a veal loin. It was about 2:00 in the afternoon and all the other shops were closed; butchers start early and most of them end their day by 1:00 p.m. Mario asked if we were still open and if I had a veal loin I could sell him. I said, &#x201c;No problem. I&#x2019;ll bring it over.&#x201d; When I got off the phone I told my dad I was going to package the veal and bring it over to this chef, and my dad started yelling. &#x201c;Are you crazy!? It&#x2019;s Friday! We don&#x2019;t start business with new customers on a Friday!&#x201d;<br><br> <br>I made my television debut on Mario Batali&#x2019;s Mediterranean Mario, which appeared on the Food Network in the early 1990s.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Why? What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>And he yelled, &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s Friday and someone you don&#x2019;t know is calling you for meat, it means they didn&#x2019;t pay their meat purveyor&#x2014;and we&#x2019;re gonna get beat out of that money.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told my dad, &#x201c;I like this guy. He sounds really cool.&#x201d;<br> <br>My dad said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you. Don&#x2019;t do it. Call the guy up and tell him to forget it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told my dad, &#x201c;Put it on me. If he doesn&#x2019;t pay, I&#x2019;ll be responsible for the money.&#x201d; And I sent one of my men to deliver the veal loin to Mario.<br> <br>As it happens, the reason Mario had called me for that veal loin is that he&#x2019;d ordered it from his regular butcher, who was our biggest competitor. But instead of delivering a veal loin, this butcher gave Mario a veal rack. When Mario said, &#x201c;Hey, I wanted a veal loin,&#x201d; the guy said, &#x201c;This is what I&#x2019;ve got. Take it or leave it.&#x201d; This kind of attitude, like my dad&#x2019;s rigid attitude toward taking new business on a Friday, was rampant in the meat business. Adjusting that attitude and making customer service the priority is one of the reasons we started to pull ahead of the competition. If it sounds basic, it is. I guess you could say that the bar was set pretty low in that department.<br> <br>The Monday after I delivered the veal loin to Mario, he called me up and gave me his entire meat order. I went to meet him and I gave him my pager number and my home number. My dad and I shared our numbers with everyone. It has always been important that our customers have access to us. For them to be able to reach us whenever they needed was vital to them, and we welcomed it.<br> <br>A few weeks later, on another Friday evening, Mario called and said that he needed a veal breast right away for a television appearance the next morning. This was before it was a normal course of events for chefs to be on TV, so I asked, &#x201c;Mario, what the hell are you going to do on a TV show with a veal breast?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mario said, &#x201c;Pat, enough with the questions. Can you get me the veal breast?&#x201d; I told him of course I could. I opened up the shop, got the veal breast ready for him, jumped in a cab, veal breast tucked under my arm, and took it across the Village to P�. When I handed the veal breast to Mario, he was so grateful. From that day on, I couldn&#x2019;t ask for a more loyal friend or customer. The show he was doing was called Mediterranean Mario. That was the beginning of his television career, and for us it was the beginning of a whole new chapter for LaFrieda Meats and the way we would come to work with chefs.</p><h2>The Knowledge of the Holy</h2><p>&#x201c;Teach us, O God, that nothing is necessary to Thee. Were anything necessary to Thee that thing would be the measure of Thine imperfection: and how could we worship one who is imperfect?&#x201d;The Knowledge of the Holy is a classic devotional that has moved the hearts of Christians for over a century! Each chapter focuses on one attribute of God&#x2013;from God&#x2019;s infinitude, immutability, grace, goodness... this book is perhaps one of the most theologically rich AND approachable devotionals in the world!</p><p><p>This classic of Christian testimony and devotion explores the attributes of God in words that fly straight to the heart. A superb aid to strengthening and deepening the spiritual life, each chapter begins with a prayer, lucidly discusses a divine aspect -- from God's infinity to God's love -- and relates that aspect to today's world, while pointing always to God's wonder and inscrutability.</p><p>A. W. Tozer asserts that the cause of many of our modern spiritual woes is the loss in today's church of a lofty concept of God. He argues persuasively that the cure lies in our rediscovery of God's majesty. "What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us," he writes. "The history of mankind will probably show that no people has ever risen above its religion, and man's spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no religion has ever been greater than its idea of God." <em>The Knowledge of the Holy</em> bearseloquent witness to the concept of God's majesty, encourages reverent meditation on the being of God, and offers a way to bring back spiritual power to our lives.</p>In 1919, five years after his decision to follow Christ, and without formal theological training, Tozer accepted an offer to pastor his first church in Nutter Fort, West Virginia. This began forty-four fruitful years of ministry with The Alliance, thirty of which he served as pastor of the Southside Alliance Church in Chicago (1928 to 1959). His final years were spent pastoring the Avenue Road (Alliance) Church in Toronto, Canada. Considered by many to be a modern-day prophet, Tozer felt that the church was on a dangerous course towards compromising with &#x201c;worldly&#x201d; concerns. In 1950, he was appointed editor of the Alliance Weekly magazine, now Alliance Life, the official publication of The Alliance. In his first editorial, dated June 3, 1950, he wrote &#x201c;It will cost something to walk slow in the parade of the ages, while excited men of time rush about confusing motion with progress. But it will pay in the long run, and the true Christian is not much interested in anything short of that.&#x201d; Prayer was of vital personal importance for Tozer. &#x201c;His preaching as well as his writings were but extensions of his prayer life,&#x201d; comments his biographer, James L. Snyder in the book, In Pursuit of God: The Life Of A.W. Tozer. &#x201c;He had the ability to make his listeners face themselves in the light of what God was saying to them&#x201d;, writes Snyder. Among the more than forty books Tozer authored, at least two are regarded as Christian classics: The Pursuit of God and The Knowledge of the Holy. His writings impress on the reader the necessity to abandon worldly comforts in favor the deeper life that comes with following Christ. Living out this simple and non-materialistic lifestyle, Tozer and his wife, Ada Cecelia Pfautz, never owned a car, preferring bus and train travel. Even after becoming a well-known Christian author, he signed away much of his royalties to those who were in need. Tozer had seven children, six boys and one girl. He was buried in Ellet cemetery, Akron, Ohio, with a simple epitaph marking his grave: &#x201c;A. W. Tozer &#x2014; A Man of God.&#x201d;</p><h2>Botanical Line Drawing: 200 Step-by-Step Flowers, Leaves, Cacti, Succulents, and Other Items Found in Nature</h2><p><b>From the artist behind the popular Pigeon Letters website, an easy, no-skills-necessary guide to drawing flowers, leaves, and cacti with 200 step-by-step prompts.</b><br><br>Line drawing is an easy-to-master art form featuring illustrative, doodle-like designs.

On October 3, 1993, about a hundred elite U.S. soldiers were dropped by helicopter into the teeming market in the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia. Their mission was to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take an hour. Instead, they found themselves pinned down through a long and terrible night fighting against thousands of heavily armed Somalis. The following morning, eighteen Americans were dead and more than seventy had been badly wounded.<br>Drawing on interviews from both sides, army records, audiotapes, and videos (some of the material is still classified), Bowden&#x2019;s minute-by-minute narrative is one of the most exciting accounts of modern combat ever written a riveting story that captures the heroism, courage, and brutality of battle.</p><p>Journalist Mark Bowden delivers a strikingly detailed account of the 1993 nightmare operation in Mogadishu that left 18 American soldiers dead and many more wounded. This early foreign-policy disaster for the Clinton administration led to the resignation of Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and a total troop withdrawal from Somalia. Bowden does not spend much time considering the context; instead he provides a moment-by-moment chronicle of what happened in the air and on the ground. His gritty narrative tells of how Rangers and elite Delta Force troops embarked on a mission to capture a pair of high-ranking deputies to warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid only to find themselves surrounded in a hostile African city. Their high-tech MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters had been shot down and a number of other miscues left them trapped through the night. Bowden describes Mogadishu as a place of Mad Max-like anarchy--implying strongly that there was never any peace for the supposed peacekeepers to keep. He makes full use of the defense bureaucracy's extensive paper trail--which includes official reports, investigations, and even radio transcripts--to describe the combat with great accuracy, right down to the actual dialogue. He supplements this with hundreds of his own interviews, turning <i>Black Hawk Down</i> into a completely authentic nonfiction novel, a lively page-turner that will make readers feel like they're standing beside the embattled troops. This will quickly be realized as a modern military classic. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Ninety-nine elite American soldiers are trapped in the middle of a hostile city. As night falls, they are surrounded by thousands of enemy gunmen. Their wounded are bleeding to death. Their ammunition and supplies are dwindling. This is the story of how they got there-and how they fought their way out. This is the story of war. Black Hawk Down drops you into a crowded marketplace in the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia with the U.S. Special Forces-and puts you in the middle of the most intense firefight American soldiers have fought since the Vietnam War. Late in the afternoon of Sunday, October 3, 1993, the soldiers of Task Force Ranger were sent on a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take them about an hour. Instead, they were pinned down through a long and terrible night in a hostile city, locked in a desperate struggle to kill or be killed. When the unit was finally rescued the following morning, eighteen American soldiers were dead and dozens more badly injured. The Somali toll was far worse: more than five hundred killed and over a thousand wounded. <p>Award-winning literary journalist Mark Bowden's dramatic narrative captures this harrowing ordeal through the eyes of the young men who fought that day. He draws on his extensive interviews of participants from both sides-as well as classified combat video and radio transcripts-to bring their stories to life. A Black Hawk pilot is shot down and besieged by an angry mob, then saved by Somalis who plan to ransom him to the local warlord. A medic desperately tries to keep his grievously wounded friend alive long enough to be evacuated-only to have him bleed to death in his arms. The company clerk, who is the butt of jokes in the barracks, rises to the task and per-forms extraordinary feats of valor. </p><p>Authoritative, gripping, and insightful, Black Hawk Down is a riveting look at the terror and exhilaration of combat, destined to become a classic of war reporting. </p><p>"Terrifyingly real . . .

In 2007 I graduated with a first class BA (Hons) degree in illustration and since then have illustrated for picture books, children's magazines, wedding invitations, logo design, website design, pattern design and hand-lettered typography. I love working with an array of materials, most often gouache, acrylic, coloured pencil and collage to create warm and friendly illustrations. I also sometimes use a bit of Photoshop, although I try not to make it too obvious... I love all things 1920s and am particularly inspired by the nostalgic childhood innocence of the books of AA Milne and Enid Blyton. I grew up in the beautiful countryside of Suffolk, spent the last ten years in lovely Lincolnshire and have recently relocated to the sunny Sussex coast with my lovely husband!</p></p><h2>Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions</h2><p>In his prime, Edward Bloom was an extraordinary man. He could outrun anybody. He never missed a day of school. He saved lives and tamed giants. Animals loved him, people loved him, women loved him. He knew more jokes than any man alive. At least that&#39;s what he told his son, William. But now Edward Bloom is dying, and William wants desperately to know the truth about his elusive father-this indefatigable teller of tall tales-before it&#39;s too late. So, using the few facts he knows, William re-creates Edward&#39;s life in a series of legends and myths, through which he begins to understand his father&#39;s great feats, and his great failings. The result is hilarious and wrenching, tender and outrageous.</p><p>In <i>Big Fish</i>, Daniel Wallace angles in search of a father and hooks instead a fictional debut as winning as any this year. From his son's standpoint, Edward Bloom leaves much to be desired. He was never around when William was growing up; he eludes serious questions with a string of tall tales and jokes. This is subject matter as old as the hills, but Wallace's take is nothing if not original. Desperate to know his father before he dies, William recreates his father's life as the stuff of legend itself. In chapters titled "In Which He Speaks to Animals," "How He Tamed the Giant," "His Immortality," and the like, Edward Bloom walks miles through a blizzard, charms the socks off a giant, even runs so fast that "he could arrive in a place before setting out to get there." In between these heroic episodes, Bloom dies not once but four times, working subtle variations on a single scene in which he counters his son's questions with stories--some of which are actually very witty, indeed. After all, he admits, "...if I shared my doubts with you, about God and love and life and death, that's all you'd have: a bunch of doubts. But now, see, you've got all these great jokes." The structure is a clever conceit, and the end product is both funny and wise. At the heart of both legends and death scenes live the same age-old questions: Who are you? What matters to you? Was I a good father? Was I a good son? In mapping the territory where myth meets everyday life, Wallace plunges straight through to fatherhood's archaic and mysterious heart. <i>--Mary Park</i><p>&#x201c;A charming whopper of a tale.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The San Diego Union-Tribune</i><br><br>In his prime, Edward Bloom was an extraordinary man.

Perfectionism is a naturally limiting mindset. Imperfectionism, however, frees us to live outside the lines, where possibilities are infinite, mistakes are allowed, and self-judgment is minimal.The old way to approach perfectionism was to inspire people to &#x201c;let go&#x201d; of their need for perfection and hope they could do it. The new way is to show people how simple but highly strategic "mini actions&#x201d; can empower them to gradually and effortlessly &#x201c;let go" of perfectionism. This book applies the science of behavior modification directly to the roots of perfectionism, resulting in a new and superior method for change. Imperfectionists aren&#x2019;t so ironic as to have perfect lives: they&#x2019;re just happier, healthier, and more productive at doing what matters.</p><p>Stephen Guise is an international bestselling author, blogger, and entrepreneur.

But then she meets her teacher, the quirky and invincible Mrs. Peterson, and her classmates, an oddly brilliant group of students each with his or her own unique talent. And it is here in The Junkyard that Trisha learns the true meaning of genius, and that this group of misfits are, in fact, wonders, all of them.<p>Based on a real-life event in Patricia Polacco's childhood, this ode to teachers will inspire all readers to find their inner genius.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p>"I was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1944. Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.<p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland. My extended family,(Stewart's family) were from the bayous of Louisiana...also great story tellers. When you are raised on HEARING stories.....NOT SEEING THEM, you become very good at telling stories yourself. So at the age of 41 I started putting stories that I told down on paper and did drawings to help illustrate them...I guess the rest is history.</p><p>"I have enjoyed a wonderful career of writing books for children . Who could have guessed that little girl that was having such a tough time in school would end up an illustrator and author. Children and adults alike ask me where I get my ideas...I get them from the same place that you do....MY IMAGINATION... I would guess the reason my imagination is so fertile is because I came from storytelling and, WE DID NOT OWN A T.V.!!!!!!!!! You see, when one is a writer, actor, dancer, musician; a creator of any kind, he or she does these things because they listen to that "voice" inside of them. All of us have that "voice". It is where all inspired thoughts come from....but when you have electronic screens in front, of you, speaking that voice for you... it DROWNS OUT THE VOICE! When I talk to children and aspiring writers, I always ask them to listen to the voice, turn off the T.V. and</p><p>"LISTEN...LISTEN...LISTEN.</p><p>"Now that I have moved back to Union City I am intending to open my house and community and invite people to come there to take part in writing seminars, story telling festivals, literature conferences and various events that celebrate children's literature."</p><p>Born Patricia Ann Barber in Lansing, Michigan, to parents of Russian and Ukrainian descent on one side and Irish on the other, Patricia Polacco grew up in both California and Michigan.

"My fondest memories are of sitting around a stove or open fire, eating apples and popping corn while listening to the old ones tell glorious stories about their homeland and the past. We are tenacious traditionalists and sentimentalists....

As Trisha enters a new school in Michigan, she hopes she won't be relegated to a special class. At her old school, she had trouble learning to read. On the first day, she is disappointed to learn that Room 206 is known as the junkyard. Fortunately, their teacher, Mrs. Peterson, doesn't allow her students to feel like misfits. She divides her Junkyard Wonders into tribes, creating a sense of unity among them. One day, the children visit a local junkyard where they discover a place full of wondrous possibilities and collect objects for a class project. Trisha and her tribe retrieve an old model plane, which they refurbish. The whole class looks forward to the science fair when they will fly the plane from the roof of the school in remembrance of a classmate who has died. The school bully tries to foil their plans, but in the end the Junkyard Wonders launch the plane and watch it soar up into the stratosphere. The touching story is accompanied by Polacco's trademark illustrations in which a motherly Mrs. Peterson presides over her busy classroom. The children's expressive faces convey their devotion to her and to each other. Pair this title with Lester L.

Indeed, wherever evil spirits have either a foothold or a stronghold, you can expect also that the gates of hell will not prevail against the church that Jesus builds. This book explores the three arenas of spiritual warfare that the maturing Christian will face: the mind, the church and the heavenly places. It provides the foundation of insight, wisdom and discernment on the nature of the battle and the keys to victory. Here are some quotes from the book: &#34;Victory begins with the name of Jesus on our lips. It is consummated by the nature of Jesus in our hearts.&#34; &#34;There are satanic strongholds over countries and communities and there are strongholds which influence the churches and individuals. Wherever a stronghold exists, it is a demonically induced pattern of thinking. Specifically, it is a house made of thoughts which has become a dwelling place for satanic and activity.&#34; &#34;Is your love growing or becoming softer, brighter, more daring and more visible? Or is it becoming more discriminating, calculating, less vulnerable and less available? This is very important issue, for your Christianity is only as real as your love. A measurable decrease in your ability to love is evidence that a stronghold of cold love is developing within you.&#34; &#34;There is a war, a very ancient war, between the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Jezebel. In this age-old battle, Elijah represents the interests of heaven: the call to repentance and the return to God. Jezebel, on the other hand, represents that unique principality whose purpose is to hinder and defeat the work of repentance.&#34;</p><p>- Audio book of the original best-selling book!This is a book about spiritual warfare. Before we proceed, however, I have two concerns. The first is our need for wisdom. There is an old European proverb worth heeding. It reads: &#34;Age and treachery will always defeat youth and zeal.&#34; Before we engage in spiritual warfare, we should know this about Satan: He is an ancient and extremely treacherous foe. On the other hand, the strength of most Christians lies primarily in idealism and untested fervor. It is not long, usually five to ten years in the ministry, and most zeal has waned. Without warning, the minister&#39;s call has deteriorated from a walk of vision to a mere job. What occurred was that zeal, by itself, challenged the treachery of hell and lost. The brightness of youthful dreams dimmed under the dark cloud of relentless satanic assault. Under the weight of growing frustrations and discouragement, compromise increased, and with it came iniquity and spiritual bondage. Yet, the real villain was not sin but ignorance. We put the devil in a doctrinal box and expected him to stay there. He did not. He undermined relationships, and our love grew cautious. He resisted us in prayer, and our faith turned weak. Disillusionment set in. After spending much time with struggling pastors, I have seen a common trend in most: They failed to discern the assault of the devil. They stood unprotected against an ancient, treacherous foe. Jesus prepared His disciples for everything, including war. They saw Him casting out demons. In fact, He sent them forth doing the same. But before He sent them out, He charged them to become wise &#34;as serpents&#34; yet innocent and harmless &#34;as doves&#34; (Matt. 10:16). This fusion of divine wisdom and Christlike innocence is the taproot of all spiritual victory. Indeed, we can defeat the enemy, but wisdom must precede warfare and virtue must come before the victory. Consequently, the goal of this book is to train the church in wisdom and call the church to innocence. We will not disregard what we have previously learned; we will still live by faith. But we must learn the ways of God, which means we must think with wisdom. And we must be pure of heart, that we may see God and gain discernment. Indeed, it is this very ignorance that has left us vulnerable to satanic attack. Of my second concern, let me say that there are no shortcuts to successful warfare, only ways to make it longer and more perilous. One way of peril is to enter battle blinded by presumption. When it comes to waging war effectively, consider carefulness to be the essence of victory. Whatever lofty spiritual plane you imagine that you are on, remember: Adam was in Paradise when he fell. Before your increased knowledge and religious experiences make you overly self-confident, recall that Solomon wrote three books of Scripture; he actually gazed upon the glory of God, yet he fell. Yes, even in your deepest worship of the Almighty, do not forget, in long ages past Lucifer himself was once in heaven pouring out praise to God. We all have seen many who have fallen. Jesus warned that the love of many would grow cold. Do not presume it cannot happen to you. Our enemy has been deceiving mankind for thousands of years. Our experience, on the other hand, spans but a brief moment. It is wisdom to recognize that we do not know all there is to know concerning warfare. Therefore, be bold but never brash or arrogant in your prayer life. Use your spiritual authority administratively, compassionately, but never presumptuously. Multitudes of well-meaning but ignorant Christians have approached the field of spiritual battle with flippant attitudes and have suffered greatly for it. Study several books and seek confirmation from the Lord for your strategies. As it is written, &#34;Prepare plans by consultation, and make war by wise guidance&#34; (Prov. 20:18). Thus, our purpose here is to help equip you for battle in each of the three primary battlegrounds: the mind, the church and the heavenly places. There are other fields or subcategories of spiritual warfare; however, these are where most of us will face conflict. One last note. A few of you will be instrumental in actually saving your cities. Our prayer is that these chapters will help and equip you for that goal. The promise of the Spirit speaks thus: &#34;There was a small city with few men in it and a great king came to it, surrounded it, and constructed large siegeworks against it. But there was found in it a poor wise man and he delivered the city by his wisdom&#34; (Eccl. 9:14-15). While many are predicting the destruction of our nation and the collapse of our cities, they have not considered the power of Christ in you. But remember, &#34;Wisdom is better than strength...wisdom is better than weapons of war&#34; (Eccl. 9:16, 18). -- Francis Frangipane --</p><h2>The Awakened Family: How to Raise Empowered, Resilient, and Conscious Children</h2><p><b><b><b><b>FINALIST FOR THE BOOKS FOR A BETTER LIFE AWARD �&nbsp;<i>NEW YORK TIMES</i>&nbsp;BESTSELLER</b><br><br>"Parents . . . you will be wowed and awed by [Dr. Shefali]."&nbsp;&#x2014;Oprah Winfrey<br><br><b>A<b>s seen on Oprah&#x2019;s <i>SuperSoul Sunday</i>,</b></b></b>&nbsp;a radically transformative plan that shows parents how to raise children to be their best, truest selves,&nbsp;<b><b>from the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Conscious Parent.</i></b></b></b><br></b><br>What if...?<br><br> What if I told you that you can put an end to all of your parenting struggles? <br><br> That you can learn to parent without fear or anxiety?<br><br> That you can end conflict with your children?<br><br> That you can create close and connected relationships within your family?<br><br> ...Would you accept this invitation to a revolution in parenting?&nbsp; <br><br>We all have the capacity to raise children who are highly resilient and emotionally connected.

Mr. Carle works in a studio near his home in western Massachusetts.</p>Forty years ago, Martin and a newcomer named Eric Carle launched a cottage industry with their now-beloved classic, Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? (1967). After narrowing the original book's broad purview in two sequels, Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? (1991), about zoo animals, and Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See? (2003), about endangered animals, this third sequel continues the thematic approach with an all-American assemblage and attention paid to the continent's many regions (a mountain goat, a rattlesnake, and a blue heron are among the creatures depicted). Martin's rhythmic text cleaves to the familiar pattern and leads readers from one double-page animal portrait to another, all crisply set against white backgrounds. Adults may appreciate the educational prospects of the North American angle, but the appeal here for the youngest children&#x2014;as with the book's predecessors&#x2014;will be in examining the complex, collaged textures within Carle's simple forms and in gleefully anticipating the appearance of each critter in the sequence.

At the urging of his wife, he resolves to take the throne by the most direct path: a dagger in the heart of King Duncan. But <i>&#x201c;blood will have blood,&#x201d; </i>and when others grow suspicious of his sudden rise to power, is Macbeth prepared to commit more murders to keep the crown?</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>Hinds offers another sensitive adaptation of classic literature in this beautifully colored and evocative rendition of Shakespeare&#x2019;s Macbeth....

Gareth Hinds&#x2019;s stellar new graphic-novel adaptation, aimed at a young adult audience, makes that abundantly clear. The play also, of course, features some epic fight scenes and lots and lots of blood, and Hinds makes the most of these opportunities to show how naturally Shakespeare takes to the comics form.<br>&#x2014;The New York Times<br><br>Following his adaptations of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, and <i>King Lear</i>, Hinds turns to the story of the Scottish king who is ruined by his ambition....

The narrator painstakingly explains that true robots are a specific type of machine designed to perform tasks in response to outside stimuli and traces their development from a hypercute 17th-century Japanese toy called a "karakuri ningyo" to today's smart homes and self-navigating aerial drones. The bird also offers general descriptions of the components in build-it-yourself robot kits, plus assorted references to robots in film and science fiction. Military drones, the purported danger of autonomous AI, and even AI rights receive glancing mentions, but troublesome issues of privacy, data theft, and jobs lost to automation go unexplored. In covering such a large subject, the narrative occasionally reads like a stodgy lecture ("Proto-robots are referenced in the Iliad"), but the sequential art&#x2014;which features a diverse cast of young STEM enthusiasts, including one wearing a hijab&#x2014;infuses the discourse with life. VERDICT Readers in upper elementary grades, especially young makers and those with a particular interest in technology, will be drawn to this title, but it would be wise to have more judicious treatments of the topic on hand to counter its relentlessly optimistic viewpoint.&#x2014;John Peters, Children's Literature Consultant, New York</p><h2>Battle of the Boss-Monster: A Branches Book (The Notebook of Doom #13) (13)</h2><p>Pick a book.

Yes, for some people it will. And for others, it will include a complete departure from their typical personality or behaviors. When you experience a foundational loss, your world is so shaken that you become accustomed to turbulence. It seems almost safer to keep the plane bouncing along, to create your own dips and turns.<br> <br>Every grieving person I know experienced their own brand of self-inflicted turbulence. They each had their own weird grief activities that you don&#x2019;t see printed in typical grief books. One woman I know spent eight hundred dollars on pots and pans after her husband died. I was not aware that it was possible to spend eight hundred dollars on pots and pans, but I was aware that it&#x2019;s possible to spend eight hundred dollars on workout clothes, which is something I did.<br> <br>I spent a lot of money after Aaron died. This is different from having a lot of money to spend, and having recently quit my job, I did not have a lot of money. But I had a huge, gaping hole in the center of my soul and it felt like I could fill it with things if I tried hard enough. I gave it a solid effort, but the hole remained.<br> <br>Not everyone spends money like crazy after they lose someone they love. But a lot of us do! A lot of us start drinking more than we did before. And a lot of us get tattoos. Or sleep around. We&#x2019;re not breaking any rules, except the one that nobody knows the origin for, the one that says grief always equals sadness.<br> <br>Grief is sadness, but it&#x2019;s also an unscratchable itch, an insatiable hunger, an unsoothable ache. It is an extreme discomfort that&#x2019;s both spiritual and physical. After Aaron&#x2019;s death, I could feel my heart beating harder and faster in my chest. The muscles in my shoulders, neck, and head tightened into thick knots. My head ached constantly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just want to take out my eyes and massage them gently,&#x201d; I said to a widow friend.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know exactly what you mean!&#x201d; she said, and we sat on my couch, pressing the heels of our hands against our eyes in silence for a few minutes before unloading our anxieties on each other.<br> <br>I was worried about money at the time. Probably because I was bleeding money through late-night Amazon purchases and was constantly in danger of overdrawing my checking account. She was worried about her reputation. She&#x2019;d met a man online and had slept with him after their second date. She hadn&#x2019;t liked him that much, but she&#x2019;d liked the idea of him, and the feeling of him. She&#x2019;d had wild, uninhibited sex with a guy she barely knew, and it was awesome. It was awesome because she got to be radically in the moment, and in her body. That sex was a respite from the grief that had consumed her. And while she wasn&#x2019;t interested in that guy anymore, she was definitely interested in having more sex with someone else. Was that excessive? Was it okay? Nobody could tell how much money I spent, but someone could, conceivably, run into her out and about on a date in our city. What would they think?<br> <br>If you haven&#x2019;t been widowed before, you may be thinking, Oh yuck, what a maladaptive coping mechanism!<br> <br>It&#x2019;s very easy to judge where someone is when you haven&#x2019;t been there.<br> <br>And it&#x2019;s easy to justify every purchase and every decision when you are sad. I said out loud many times, &#x201c;My husband is dead! I can do what I want!&#x201d; It became a catchphrase for me and Moe, my Hot Young Widows Club co-founder. We could do whatever we wanted! We could get more tattoos. I could change my hair color from lavender to blond to a blue that turned green accidentally. I could quit my job! I could start a nonprofit and write a book! I could move in with my mom if I wanted to! What looked spontaneous or even bizarre to the people around me made perfect sense to me. My dad and my husband and my last baby with Aaron were dead. So what if I lose some money, or some hair? So what if I get a bad tattoo?<br> <br>My in-box is filled with people who are mystified by their grief behaviors. They are wondering if they are normal. They want to know if they are grieving right.<br> <br>Why would a suburban mother suddenly want a neck tattoo? How could a person who just watched his wife die of cancer have an appetite for sex? Why do they always feel like they have the flu?<br> <br>I tell them all the same thing, which is that I am not a doctor or a licensed therapist, but I am an enthusiastic, amateur grief anthropologist. Which is my way of saying that I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of people grieve a lot of different ways and I consider them all normal.<br> <br>It is normal to hate your friend because their husband is alive and yours is not. It is normal to bristle at seemingly innocuous questions like, &#x201c;How are you holding up?&#x201d; It is normal to catalog all the mistakes your friends and family are making around you and your grief. It&#x2019;s normal to not shed a tear at your child&#x2019;s funeral, but then to sob uncontrollably in the Target parking lot when you see their doppelg�nger toddling through the automatic doors. It&#x2019;s all terrible, and uncomfortable, and miserable, and normal.</p><h2>Christmas Is Coming! An Advent Book: Crafts, games, recipes, stories, and more!

I came into this world on the fifth day of the six month of the third year of Emperor Daoguang&#x2019;s reign. Puwei, my home village, is in Yongming County, the county of Everlasting Brightness. Most people who live here are descended from the Yao ethnic tribe. From the storytellers who visited Puwei when I was a girl, I learned that the Yao first arrived in this area twelve hundred years ago during the Tang dynasty, but most families came a century later, when they fled the Mongol armies who invaded the north. Although the people of our region have never been rich, we have rarely been so poor that women had to work in the fields.<br><br>We were members of the Yi family line, one of the original Yao clans and the most common in the district. My father and uncle leased seven mou of land from a rich landowner who lived in the far west of the province. They cultivated that land with rice, cotton, taro, and kitchen crops. My family home was typical in the sense that it had two stories and faced south. A room upstairs was designated for women&#x2019;s gathering and for unmarried girls to sleep. Rooms for each family unit and a special room for our animals flanked the downstairs main room, where baskets filled with eggs or oranges and strings of drying chilies hung from the central beam to keep them safe from mice, chickens, or a roaming pig. We had a table and stools against one wall. A hearth where Mama and Aunt did the cooking occupied a corner on the opposite wall. We did not have windows in our main room, so we kept open the door to the alley outside our house for light and air in the warm months. The rest of our rooms were small, our floor was hard-packed earth, and, as I said, our animals lived with us.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve never thought much about whether I was happy or if I had fun as a child. I was a so-so girl who lived with a so-so family in a so-so village. I didn&#x2019;t know that there might be another way to live, and I didn&#x2019;t worry about it either. But I remember the day I began to notice and think about what was around me. I had just turned five and felt as though I had crossed a big threshold. I woke up before dawn with something like a tickle in my brain. That bit of irritation made me alert to everything I saw and experienced that day.<br><br>I lay between Elder Sister and Third Sister. I glanced across the room to my cousin&#x2019;s bed. Beautiful Moon, who was my age, hadn&#x2019;t woken up yet, so I stayed still, waiting for my sisters to stir. I faced Elder Sister, who was four years older than I. Although we slept in the same bed, I didn&#x2019;t get to know her well until I had my feet bound and joined the women&#x2019;s chamber myself. I was glad I wasn&#x2019;t looking in Third Sister&#x2019;s direction. I always told myself that since she was a year younger she was too insignificant to think about. I don&#x2019;t think my sisters adored me either, but the indifference we showed one another was just a face we put on to mask our true desires. We each wanted Mama to notice us. We each vied for Baba&#x2019;s attention. We each hoped we would spend time every day with Elder Brother, since as the first son he was the most precious person in our family. I did not feel that kind of jealousy with Beautiful Moon. We were good friends and happy that our lives would be linked together until we both married out.<br><br>The four of us looked very similar. We each had black hair that was cut short, we were very thin, and we were close in height. Otherwise, our distinguishing features were few. Elder Sister had a mole above her lip. Third Sister&#x2019;s hair was always tied up in little tufts, because she did not like Mama to comb it. Beautiful Moon had a pretty round face, while my legs were sturdy from running and my arms strong from carrying my baby brother.<br><br>&#x201c;Girls!&#x201d; Mama called up the stairs to us.<br><br>That was enough to wake up the others and get us all out of bed. Elder Sister hurriedly got dressed and went downstairs. Beautiful Moon and I were slower, because we had to dress not only ourselves but Third Sister as well. Then together we went downstairs, where Aunt swept the floor, Uncle sang a morning song, Mama&#x2014;with Second Brother swaddled on her back&#x2014;poured the last of the water into the teapot to heat, and Elder Sister chopped scallions for the rice porridge we call congee. My sister gave me a tranquil look that I took to mean that she had already earned the approval of my family this morning and was safe for the rest of the day. I tucked away my resentment, not understanding that what I saw as her self-satisfaction was something closer to the cheerless resignation that would settle on my sister after she married out.<br><br>&#x201c;Beautiful Moon! Lily! Come here! Come here!&#x201d;<br><br>My aunt greeted us this way each and every morning. We ran to her. Aunt kissed Beautiful Moon and patted my bottom affectionately. Then Uncle swooped in, swept up Beautiful Moon in his arms, and kissed her. After he set her back down, he winked at me and pinched my cheek.<br><br>You know the old saying about beautiful people marrying beautiful people and talented people marrying talented people? That morning I concluded that Uncle and Aunt were two ugly people and therefore perfectly matched. Uncle, my father&#x2019;s younger brother, had bowlegs, a bald head, and a full shiny face. Aunt was plump, and her teeth were like jagged stones protruding from a karst cave. Her bound feet were not very small, maybe fourteen centimeters long, twice the size of what mine eventually became. I&#x2019;d heard wicked tongues in our village say that this was the reason Aunt&#x2014;who was of healthy stock, with wide hips&#x2014;could not carry a son to term. I&#x2019;d never heard these kinds of reproaches in our home, not even from Uncle. To me, they had an ideal marriage; he was an affectionate rat and she was a dutiful ox. Every day they provided happiness around the hearth.<br><br>My mother had yet to acknowledge that I was in the room. This is how it had been for as long as I could remember, but on that day I perceived and felt her disregard. Melancholy sank into me, whisking away the joy I had just felt with Aunt and Uncle, stunning me with its power. Then, just as quickly, the feeling disappeared, because Elder Brother, who was six years older than I was, called me to help him with his morning chores. Having been born in the year of the horse, it is in my nature to love the outdoors, but even more important I got to have Elder Brother completely to myself. I knew I was lucky and that my sisters would hold this against me, but I didn&#x2019;t care. When he talked to me or smiled at me I didn&#x2019;t feel invisible.<br><br>We ran outside. Elder Brother hauled water up from the well and filled buckets for us to carry. We took them back to the house and set out again to gather firewood. We made a pile, then Elder Brother loaded my arms with the smaller sticks. He scooped up the rest and we headed home. When we got there, I handed the sticks to Mama, hoping for her praise. After all, it&#x2019;s not so easy for a little girl to lug a bucket of water or carry firewood. But Mama didn&#x2019;t say anything.<br><br>Even now, after all these years, it is difficult for me to think about Mama and what I realized on that day. I saw so clearly that I was inconsequential to her. I was a third child, a second worthless girl, too little to waste time on until it looked like I would survive my milk years. She looked at me the way all mothers look at their daughters&#x2014;as a temporary visitor who was another mouth to feed and a body to dress until I went to my husband&#x2019;s home. I was five, old enough to know I didn&#x2019;t deserve her attention, but suddenly I craved it. I longed for her to look at me and talk to me the way she did with Elder Brother. But even in that moment of my first truly deep desire, I was smart enough to know that Mama wouldn&#x2019;t want me to interrupt her during this busy time when so often she had scolded me for talking too loudly or had swatted at the air around me because I got in her way. Instead, I vowed to be like Elder Sister and help as quietly and carefully as I could.<br><br>Grandmother tottered into the room. Her face looked like a dried plum, and her back bent so far forward that she and I saw eye to eye.<br><br>&#x201c;Help your grandmother,&#x201d; Mama ordered. &#x201c;See if she needs anything.&#x201d;<br><br>Even though I had just made a promise to myself, I hesitated. Grandmother&#x2019;s gums were sour and sticky in the mornings, and no one wanted to get near her. I sidled up to her, holding my breath, but she waved me away impatiently. I moved so quickly that I bumped into my father&#x2014;the eleventh and most important person in our household.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t reprimand me or say anything to anyone else. As far as I knew, he wouldn&#x2019;t speak until this day was behind him. He sat down and waited to be served. I watched Mama closely as she wordlessly poured his tea. I may have been afraid that she would notice me during her morning routine, but she was even more mindful in her dealings with my father. He rarely hit my mother and he never took a concubine, but her caution with him made us all heedful.<br><br>Aunt put bowls on the table and spooned out the congee, while Mama nursed the baby. After we ate, my father and my uncle set out for the fields, and my mother, aunt, grandmother, and older sister went upstairs to the women&#x2019;s chamber. I wanted to go with Mama and the other women in our family, but I wasn&#x2019;t old enough. To make matters worse, I now had to share Elder Brother with my baby brother and Third Sister when we went back outside.<br><br>I carried the baby on my back as we cut grass and foraged for roots for our pig. Third Sister followed us as best she could. She was a funny, ornery little thing. She acted spoiled, when the only ones who had a right to be spoiled were our brothers. She thought she was the most beloved in our family, although nothing showed her that this was true.<br><br>Once done with our chores, our little foursome explored the village, going up and down the alleys between the houses until we came across some other girls jumping rope. My brother stopped, took the baby, and let me jump too. Then we went home for lunch&#x2014;something simple, rice and vegetable only. Afterward, Elder Brother left with the men, and the rest of us went upstairs. Mama nursed the baby again, then he and Third Sister took their afternoon naps. Even at that age I enjoyed being in the women&#x2019;s chamber with my grandmother, aunt, sister, cousin, and especially my mother. Mama and Grandmother wove cloth, Beautiful Moon and I made balls of yarn, Aunt sat with brush and ink, carefully writing her secret characters, while Elder Sister waited for her four sworn sisters to arrive for an afternoon visit.<br><br>Soon enough we heard the sound of four pairs of lily feet come quietly up the stairs. Elder Sister greeted each girl with a hug, and the five of them clustered together in a corner. They didn&#x2019;t like me intruding on their conversations, but I studied them nevertheless, knowing that I would be part of my own sworn sisterhood in another two years. The girls were all from Puwei, which meant that they could assemble often, and not just on special gathering days such as Catching Cool Breezes or the Birds Festival. The sisterhood had been formed when the girls turned seven. To cement the relationship, their fathers had each contributed twenty-five jin of rice, which was stored at our house. Later, when each girl married out, her portion of rice would be sold so her sworn sisters could buy gifts for her. The last bit of rice would be sold on the occasion of the last sworn sister&#x2019;s marriage. That would mark the end of the sisterhood, since the girls would have all married out to distant villages, where they would be too busy with their children and obeying their mothers-in-law to have time for old friendships.<br><br>Even with her friends, Elder Sister did not attempt to grab attention. She sat placidly with the other girls as they embroidered and told funny stories. When their chatter and giggles grew loud, my mother sternly hushed them, and another new thought popped into my head: Mama never did that when my grandmother&#x2019;s late-life sworn sisters came to visit. After her children were grown, my grandmother had been invited to join a new group of five sworn sisters in Puwei. Only two of them plus my grandmother, all widows, were still alive, and they visited at least once a week. They made each other laugh and together they shared bawdy jokes that we girls didn&#x2019;t understand. On those occasions, Mama was too afraid of her mother-in-law to dare ask them to stop. Or maybe she was too busy.<br><br>Mama ran out of yarn and stood up to get more. For a moment she stayed very still, staring pensively at nothing. I had a nearly uncontrollable desire to run into her arms and scream, See me, see me, see me! But I didn&#x2019;t. Mama&#x2019;s feet had been badly bound by her mother. Instead of golden lilies, Mama had ugly stumps. Instead of swaying when she walked, she balanced herself on a cane. If she put the cane aside, her four limbs went akimbo as she tried to maintain her balance. Mama was too unsteady on her feet for anyone ever to hug or kiss her.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it time for Beautiful Moon and Lily to go outside?&#x201d; Aunt asked, cutting into my mother&#x2019;s daydream. &#x201c;They could help Elder Brother with his chores.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t need their help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Aunt admitted, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s a nice day&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><h2>Evan-Moor Daily Language Review, Grade 5 Actvities Homeschooling &amp; Classroom Resource Workbook, Reproducible Worksheets, Teacher Edition, Daily Practice, Skills Accessment, Grammar, Punctuation</h2><p>For fifth graders seeking to improve their language skills and vocabulary, the Evan-Moor Daily Language Review Activity Book, Grade 5 provides an excellent source of daily work.

In 1999 Jennifer Appel left to open Buttercup Bake Shop, which has two locations in Manhattan, where she resides with her husband and daughter. Allysa Torey lives with her son Wilson Henry in upstate New York, where she spends her time writing, cooking, gardening, and taking long walks through the hayfields with her collies Sam, Daisy, and Honey.<b> Introduction </b> <p> When we first opened the Magnolia Bakery, we imagined a cozy, old-fashioned shop where people could come for a cup of coffee and something sweet. We expected our customers to include some local regulars and lots of neighborhood families. We thought we'd close at seven each evening so we could go home and make dinner. We never expected that Magnolia would turn into a city-wide hangout, much less that on weekend nights there would be lines out the door! </p> <p> The Magnolia Bakery came into being over a brunch conversation during which Jennifer and I expressed for the umpteenth time our mutual frustration with our jobs and lifestyles. We finally decided that something would be done about it and opened up a wholesale baking business in early 1996. We soon received very positive feedback from our customers. When a retail space became available in our favorite neighborhood, we grabbed the opportunity. New York City's West Village seemed ideal. It was low-key and family-oriented, a place where we could do what we loved where we loved it. Over the course of two months and with the help of an adept construction crew, we transformed an empty shell into a warm cozy kitchen. </p> <p> Our customers would stop by as much for the feel of the store as they did for the desserts. With its vintage American decor and desserts, customers often told us that walking into the bakery was just like stepping back in time to their grandmother's kitchen. They would come in for a slice of cake and end up with a little piece of their childhood. Over the years, people have wanted to meet us to say thanks for making the red velvet cake they remembered from church picnics or the banana pudding just like their mom used to make. While the business itself was fast paced and hectic at times, our original aim and values remained the same: we simply did everything the oldfashioned way, using the best and freshest ingredients, and took the time to produce delicious homemade treats. </p> <p> A few years into business together, Jennifer left Magnolia to open up her own bakery, The Buttercup Bake Shop in midtown Manhattan. After the publication of <i>The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook</i>, many people suggested that I do a second book. While working full time at the bakery, the idea of writing another cookbook seemed impossible. Finally, after putting together a committed staff at the shop, I was able to move full time to my country house, and I could really consider the idea, knowing that I would have the time and energy necessary to write the book I wanted to write. I created the recipes for <i>More From Magnolia</i> in an old-fashioned style, but with new ideas and different combinations of ingredients to keep things interesting and fun. </p> <p> As the unexpected popularity of our cupcakes grew, the bakery got busier and busier and the lines got longer and longer. After ten wonderful years at Magnolia, I decided to sell the business to stay home full time with my growing family. The new owners have opened more Magnolia Bakeries and continue to be successful. </p> <p> This collection of recipes brings together all of the recipes in both Magnolia cookbooks -- classic American desserts reflecting the sensibilities of the bakery and my home. </p> <p> Allysa Torey </p> <p> Introduction copyright � 2009 by Allysa Torey</p></p><h2>Today Matters: 12 Daily Practices to Guarantee Tomorrow&#39;s Success</h2><p>Most of us look at our days in the wrong way: We exaggerate yesterday.

Think about all those little rituals that sustain you throughout your day&#x2014;from the moment you wake up until that last, lonely midnight hour when you guzzle a gallon of NyQuil to drown out the persistent voice in your head. The one that whispers you should give up, give in, that tomorrow won&#x2019;t be better than today. Think about the absurdity of brushing your teeth, of arguing with your mother over the appropriateness of what you&#x2019;re wearing to school, of homework, of grade-point averages and boyfriends and hot school lunches.<br> <br>And life.<br> <br>Think about the absurdity of life.<br> <br>When you break down the things we do every day to their component pieces, you begin to understand how ridiculous they are. Like kissing, for instance. You wouldn&#x2019;t let a stranger off the street spit into your mouth, but you&#x2019;ll swap saliva with the boy or girl who makes your heart race and your pits sweat and gives you boners at the worst fucking times. You&#x2019;ll stick your tongue in his mouth or her mouth or their mouth, and let them reciprocate without stopping to consider where else their tongue has been, or whether they&#x2019;re giving you mouth herpes or mono or leftover morsels of their tuna-salad sandwich.<br> <br>We shave our legs and pluck our eyebrows and slather our bodies with creams and lotions. We starve ourselves so we can fit into the perfect pair of jeans, we pollute our bodies with drugs to increase our muscles so we&#x2019;ll look ripped without a shirt. We drive fast and party hard and study for exams that don&#x2019;t mean dick in the grand scheme of the cosmos.<br> <br>Physicists have theorized that we live in an infinite and infinitely expanding universe, and that everything in it will eventually repeat. There are infinite copies of your mom and your dad and your clothes-stealing little sister. There are infinite copies of you. Despite what you&#x2019;ve spent your entire life believing, you are not a special snowflake. Somewhere out there, another you is living your life. Chances are, they&#x2019;re living it better. They&#x2019;re learning to speak French or screwing their brains out instead of loafing on the couch in their boxers, stuffing their face with bowl after bowl of Fruity Oatholes while wondering why they&#x2019;re all alone on a Friday night. But that&#x2019;s not even the worst part. What&#x2019;s really going to send you running over the side of the nearest bridge is that none of it matters. I&#x2019;ll die, you&#x2019;ll die, we&#x2019;ll all die, and the things we&#x2019;ve done, the choices we&#x2019;ve made, will amount to nothing.<br> <br>Out in the world, crawling in a field at the edge of some bullshit town with a name like Shoshoni or Medicine Bow, is an ant. You weren&#x2019;t aware of it. Didn&#x2019;t know whether it was a soldier, a drone, or the queen. Didn&#x2019;t care if it was scouting for food to drag back to the nest or building new tunnels for wriggly ant larvae. Until now that ant simply didn&#x2019;t exist for you. If I hadn&#x2019;t mentioned it, you would have continued on with your life, pinballing from one tedious task to the next&#x2014;shoving your tongue into the bacterial minefield of your girlfriend&#x2019;s mouth, doodling the variations of your combined names on the cover of your notebook&#x2014;waiting for electronic bits to zoom through the air and tell you that someone was thinking about you. That for one fleeting moment you were the most significant person in someone else&#x2019;s insignificant life. But whether you knew about it or not, that ant is still out there doing ant things while you wait for the next text message to prove that out of the seven billion self-centered people on this planet, you are important.

Wright for Everyone Bible Study Guides)</h2><p>Things don&#39;t always go the way we intend. It&#39;s easy to feel discouraged because what we hope for is badly thwarted, or because people make life difficult. Paul, writing to the Philippians from prison, certainly knew what it was like to have plans interrupted. But he maintains robust confidence in God&#39;s overruling power, even when everything seems to be going wrong. These eight studies will help us learn from Paul the art of seeing God&#39;s purposes working out through problems and difficulties, and will deepen our own confidence in God&#39;s power.</p><p><strong>N.

The book is cited by Mahatma Gandhi as one of the chief influences in the development of his philosophy of non-violence. Tolstoy takes the reader to the heart of the message of Jesus Christ, laying aside the common dogmas of the church in favor of a literal understanding of Christ&#39;s teachings. This brings his philosophy to one of strict non-violence and a complete overhaul of the structures of modern society. The work is a masterpiece in the realm of Christianity.</p><p>Count Lev (Leo) Nikolayevich Tolstoy (1828-1910), was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time. Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels &#34;War and Peace&#34; (1869) and &#34;Anna Karenina&#34; (1877), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction. In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work &#34;A Confession&#34;. His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist. Tolstoy&#39;s ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as &#34;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&#34;, had a profound impact on non-violent leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><h2>Baditude!

Not many, but a few. Thinking about the future was one of them. Dill didn&#x2019;t enjoy doing that. He didn&#x2019;t much care for talking about religion with his mother. That never left him feeling happy or saved. He loathed the flash of recognition that usually passed across people&#x2019;s faces when they learned his name. That rarely resulted in a conversation he enjoyed.<br><br>And he really didn&#x2019;t enjoy visiting his father, Pastor Dillard Early Sr., at Riverbend Prison. His trip to Nashville that day wasn&#x2019;t to visit his father, but he still had a nagging sense of unformed dread and he didn&#x2019;t know why. It might have been because school was starting the next day, but this felt different somehow than in years past.<br><br>It would have been worse except for the excitement of seeing Lydia. The worst days spent with her were better than the best days spent without her.<br><br>Dill stopped strumming his guitar, leaned forward, and wrote in the dollar-store composition book open on the floor in front of him. The decrepit window air conditioner wheezed, losing the battle against the mugginess of his living room.<br><br>The thudding of a wasp at the window caught his attention over the laboring of the air conditioner. He rose from the ripped sofa and walked to the window, which he jimmied until it screeched open.<br><br>Dill swatted the wasp toward the crack. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to stay in here,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;This house is no place to die. Go on. Get.&#x201d;<br><br>It alighted on the sill, considered the house one more time, and flew free. Dill shut the window, almost having to hang from it to close it all the way.<br><br>His mother walked in wearing her motel maid&#x2019;s uniform. She looked tired. She always did, which made her seem much older than her thirty-five years. &#x201c;What were you doing with the window open and the AC on? Electricity&#x2019;s not free.&#x201d;<br><br>Dill turned. &#x201c;Wasp.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why you all dressed to leave? You going somewhere?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nashville.&#x201d; Please don&#x2019;t ask the question I know you&#x2019;re going to ask.<br><br>&#x201c;Visiting your father?&#x201d; She sounded both hopeful and accusatory.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Dill looked away.<br><br>His mother stepped toward him and sought his eyes. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>Dill avoided her glare. &#x201c;Because. That&#x2019;s not why we&#x2019;re going.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me. Lydia. Travis. Same as always.&#x201d;<br><br>She put a hand on her hip. &#x201c;Why you going, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;School clothes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your clothes are fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No they&#x2019;re not. They&#x2019;re getting too small.&#x201d; Dill lifted his skinny arms, his T-shirt exposing his lean stomach.<br><br>&#x201c;With what money?&#x201d; His mother&#x2019;s brow--already more lined than most women&#x2019;s her age--furrowed.<br><br>&#x201c;Just my tips from helping people to their cars with their groceries.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Free trip to Nashville. You should visit your father.&#x201d;<br><br>You better go visit your father or else, you mean. Dill set his jaw and looked at her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to. I hate it there.&#x201d;<br><br>She folded her arms. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not meant to be fun. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s prison. Think he enjoys it?&#x201d;<br><br>Probably more than I enjoy it. Dill shrugged and gazed back out the window. &#x201c;Doubt it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t ask for much, Dillard. It would make me happy. And it would make him happy.&#x201d;<br><br>Dill sighed and said nothing. You ask for plenty without ever actually asking for it.<br><br>&#x201c;You owe him. You&#x2019;re the only one with enough free time.&#x201d;<br><br>She would hang it over his head. If he didn&#x2019;t visit, she would make it hurt worse for longer than if he gave in. The dread in Dill&#x2019;s stomach intensified. &#x201c;Maybe. If we have time.&#x201d;<br><br>As his mother was about to try to drag a firmer commitment from him, a bestickered Toyota Prius zoomed up his road and screeched to a stop in front of his house with a honk. Thank you, God.<br><br>&#x201c;I gotta go,&#x201d; Dill said. &#x201c;Have a good day at work.&#x201d; He hugged his mother goodbye.<br><br>&#x201c;Dillard--&#x201d;<br><br>But he was out the door before she had the chance. He felt burdened as he stepped into the bright summer morning, shielding his eyes against the sun. The humidity mounted an assault even at nine-twenty in the morning--like a hot, wet towel wrapped around his face. He glanced at the peeling white Calvary Baptist Church up the street from his house. He squinted to read the sign out of habit. no jesus, no peace. know jesus, know peace.<br><br>What if you know Jesus but have no peace? Does that mean the sign is wrong, or does that mean you don&#x2019;t know Jesus quite as well as you think? Dill hadn&#x2019;t been raised to consider either a particularly good outcome.<br><br>He opened the car door and got in. The frigid air conditioning made his pores shrink.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Lydia.&#x201d;<br><br>She grabbed a worn copy of The Secret History off the passenger seat before Dill sat on it, and tossed it in the backseat. &#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m not. But I have to pretend. Social contractual obligations and whatnot.&#x201d;<br><br>You could set your clock by Lydia&#x2019;s being twenty minutes late. And it was no use trying to trick her by telling her to meet you at a time twenty minutes before you really wanted to meet. That only made her forty minutes late. She had a sixth sense.<br><br>Lydia leaned over and hugged Dill. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re already sweaty and it&#x2019;s still morning. Boys are so gross.&#x201d;<br><br>The black frames of her glasses creaked against his cheekbone. Her tousled smoky-blue hair--the color of a faded November sky streaked with clouds--smelled like honey, fig, and vetiver. He breathed it in. It made his head swim in a pleasant way. She had dressed for Nashville in a vintage sleeveless red gingham blouse with black high-waisted denim shorts and vintage cowboy boots. He loved the way she dressed--every twist and turn, and there were many.<br><br>Dill buckled his seat belt the instant before her acceleration pressed him into his seat. &#x201c;Sorry. I don&#x2019;t have access to AC that makes August feel like December.&#x201d; He sometimes went days without feeling air as cool as in Lydia&#x2019;s car except for when he opened the refrigerator.<br><br>She reached out and turned the air conditioning down a couple of clicks. &#x201c;I think my car should fight global warming in every possible way.&#x201d;<br><br>Dill angled one of the vents toward his face. &#x201c;You ever think about how weird it is that Earth is hurtling through the black vacuum of space, where it&#x2019;s like a thousand below zero, and meanwhile we&#x2019;re down here sweating?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I often think about how weird it is that Earth is hurtling through the black vacuum of space and meanwhile you&#x2019;re down here being a total weirdo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So, where are we going in Nashville? Opry Mills Mall or something?&#x201d;<br><br>Lydia glared at him and looked back at the road. She extended her hand toward him, still looking forward. &#x201c;Excuse me, I thought we&#x2019;d been best friends since ninth grade, but apparently we&#x2019;ve never even met. Lydia Blankenship. You are?&#x201d;<br><br>Dill took advantage of the opportunity to take her hand. &#x201c;Dillard Early. Maybe you&#x2019;ve heard of my father by the same name.&#x201d;<br><br>It had thoroughly scandalized Forrestville, Tennessee, when Pastor Early of the Church of Christ&#x2019;s Disciples with Signs of Belief went to the state penitentiary--and not for the reasons anyone expected. Everyone assumed he&#x2019;d get in trouble someday for the twenty-seven or so rattlesnakes and copperheads his congregants passed around each Sunday. No one knew with certainty what law they were breaking, but it seemed unlawful somehow. And the Tennessee Department of Wildlife did take custody of the snakes after his arrest. Or people thought perhaps he&#x2019;d run afoul of the law by inducing his flock to drink diluted battery acid and strychnine, another favored worship activity. But no, he went to Riverbend Prison for a different sort of poison: possession of more than one hundred images depicting a minor engaged in sexual activity.<br><br>Lydia tilted her head and squinted. &#x201c;Dillard Early, huh? The name rings a bell. Anyway, yes, we&#x2019;re driving an hour and a half to Nashville to go to Opry Mills Mall and buy you the same sweatshop garbage that Tyson Reed, Logan Walker, Hunter Henry, their intolerable girlfriends, and all of their horrible friends will also be wearing on the first day of senior year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ask a simple question--&#x201d;<br><br>She raised a finger. &#x201c;A stupid question.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A stupid question.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Dill&#x2019;s eyes fell on Lydia&#x2019;s hands at the steering wheel. They were slender, with long, graceful fingers; vermilion-colored nails; and lots of rings. The rest of her wasn&#x2019;t ungraceful but her fingers were affirmatively and aggressively graceful. He relished watching her drive. And type. And do everything she did with her hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you call Travis to tell him you were running late?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did I call you to tell you I was running late?&#x201d; She took a turn fast, squealing her tires.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Think it&#x2019;ll come as a surprise to him that I&#x2019;m running late?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br><br>The August air was a steamy haze. Dill could already hear the bugs, whatever they were called. The ones that made a pulsing, rattling drone on a sweltering morning, signaling that the day would only grow hotter. Not cicadas, he didn&#x2019;t think. Rattlebugs. That seemed as good a name as any.<br><br>&#x201c;What am I working with today?&#x201d; Lydia asked. Dill gave her a blank stare. She held up her hand and rubbed her fingers together. &#x201c;Come on, buddy, keep up here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. Fifty bucks. Can you work with that?&#x201d;<br><br>She snorted. &#x201c;Of course I can work with that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, but no dressing me weird.&#x201d;<br><br>Lydia extended her hand to him again--more forcefully, as though karate chopping a board. &#x201c;No, but seriously. Have we met? What was your name again?&#x201d;<br><br>Dill grasped her hand again. Any excuse. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in a mood today.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the mood to receive a little credit. Not much. Don&#x2019;t spoil me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t dream of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the last two years of school shopping, have I ever made you look ridiculous?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. I mean, I still caught hell for stuff, but I&#x2019;m sure that would&#x2019;ve happened no matter what I wore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It would. Because we go to school with people who wouldn&#x2019;t recognize great style if it bit them right on their ass. I have a vision for you, planted in rustic Americana. Western shirts with pearl snaps. Denim. Classic, masculine, iconic lines. While everyone else at Forrestville High tries desperately to appear as though they don&#x2019;t live in Forrestville, we&#x2019;ll embrace and own your rural Southernness, continuing in the vein of 1970s Townes Van Zandt meets Whiskeytown-era Ryan Adams.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve planned this.&#x201d; Dill savored the idea of Lydia thinking about him. Even if only as a glorified mannequin.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you expect less?&#x201d;<br><br>Dill breathed in the fragrance of her car. Vanilla car freshener mixed with french fries, jasmine-orange-ginger lotion, and heated makeup. They were almost to Travis&#x2019;s house. He lived close to Dill. They stopped at an intersection, and Lydia took a selfie with her cell phone and handed it to Dill.<br><br>&#x201c;Get me from your angle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You sure? Your fans might start thinking you have friends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hardy har. Do it and let me worry about that.&#x201d;<br><br>A couple of blocks later, they pulled up to the Bohannon house. It was white and rundown with a weathered tin roof and wood stacked on the front porch. Travis&#x2019;s father perspired in the gravel driveway, changing out the spark plugs on his pickup that had the name of the family business, Bohannon Lumber, stenciled on the side. He cast Dill and Lydia a briny glare, cupped his hand to his mouth, and yelled, &#x201c;Travis, you got company,&#x201d; saving Lydia the trouble of honking.<br><br>&#x201c;Pappy Bohannon looks to be in a bit of a mood himself,&#x201d; Lydia said.<br><br>&#x201c;To hear Travis tell it, Pappy Bohannon is in a permanent mood. It&#x2019;s called being a giant asshole, and it&#x2019;s incurable.&#x201d;<br><br>A moment or two passed before Travis came loping outside. Ambling, perhaps. Whatever bears do. All six feet, six inches, and 250 pounds of him. His shaggy, curly red hair and patchy red teenager beard were wet from the shower. He wore his signature black work boots, black Wranglers, and baggy black dress shirt buttoned all the way up. Around his neck, he wore a necklace with a chintzy pewter dragon gripping a purple crystal ball--a memento from some Renaissance festival. He always wore it. He carried a dog-eared paperback from the Bloodfall series, something else he was seldom without.<br><br>Halfway to the car, he stopped, raised a finger, and spun and ran back to the house, almost tripping over his feet. Lydia hunched over, her hands on the wheel, watching him.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh no. The staff,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;He forgot the staff.&#x201d;<br><br>Dill groaned and did a facepalm. &#x201c;Yep. The staff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The oaken staff,&#x201d; Lydia said in a grandiose, medieval voice.<br><br>&#x201c;The magic staff of kings and lords and wizards and . . . elves or whatever.&#x201d;<br><br>Travis returned, clutching his staff, symbols and faces carved on it with clumsy hands. His father glanced up with a pained expression, shook his head, and resumed work. Travis opened the car door.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, guys.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The staff? Really?&#x201d; Lydia said.<br><br>&#x201c;I bring it on journeys. &#x2019;Sides, what if we need it to protect ourselves? Nashville is dangerous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Lydia said, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s not dangerous because of all the staff-wielding brigands. They have guns now. Gun beats staff in gun-staff-scissors.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I highly doubt we&#x2019;ll get in a staff fight in Nashville,&#x201d; Dill said.<br><br>&#x201c;I like it. It makes me feel good to have it.&#x201d;<br><br>Lydia rolled her eyes and put the car into gear. &#x201c;Bless your heart. Okay, boys. Let&#x2019;s do this. The last time we ever go school shopping together, thank the sweet Lord.&#x201d;<br><br>And with that pronouncement, Dill realized that the dread in his stomach wouldn&#x2019;t be going away any time soon. Maybe never. The final indignity? He doubted he&#x2019;d even get a good song out of it.<br>2<br><br>Lydia<br><br>The Nashville skyline loomed in the distance. Lydia liked Nashville. Vanderbilt was on her college list. Not high on the list, but there. Thinking about colleges put her in a good mood, as did being in a big city. All in all, she felt a lot happier than she had the day before the start of any school year in her life. She could only imagine what she&#x2019;d be feeling the day before next school year--freshman year of college.<br><br>As they entered the outskirts of Nashville, Dill stared out the window. Lydia had given him her camera and assigned him to be expedition photographer, but he forgot to take pictures. He had his normal faraway affect and distinct air of melancholy. Today seemed different somehow, though. Lydia knew that visits to Nashville were a bittersweet affair for him because of his father, and she&#x2019;d consciously tried to pick a route that would differ from the one he took to visit the prison. She spent a fair amount of time on Google Maps plotting, but to no avail. There were only so many routes from Forrestville to Nashville.</p><h2>Uncommon: Finding Your Path to Significance</h2><p>The <i>New York Times</i> bestseller is now in softcover with a bonus chapter on how the &#x201c;Dare to Be Uncommon&#x201d; movement is reaching schools, teams, and families across the country and an update on Tony&#x2019;s life since retiring as head coach of the Indianapolis Colts.

In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the third-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation.</p> <p>During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message&#x2014;that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed <i>Mindset Mathematics</i> around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual math tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in <i>Mindset Mathematics</i> reflect the lessons from brain science that:</p> <ul> <li>There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels.</li> <li>Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth.</li> <li>Speed is unimportant in mathematics.</li> <li>Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics.</li> </ul> <p>With engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals that will help kids get excited about mathematics, <i>Mindset Mathematics</i> is organized around nine big ideas which emphasize the connections within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and can be used with any current curriculum.</p></p><p><p><b>Engage Your Students in Visual, Creative Explorations of the Big Ideas in Mathematics</b> </p><p>The Mindset Mathematics series offers a unique, research-based visual approach to exploring the big ideas in mathematics, which is essential to future mathematics success. This hands-on resource is for any teacher who wants to engage their third grade students in reasoning and persisting through problems, and provides activities that will engage students' interest and show them the many ways that mathematics is important in their lives. </p><p>During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message: Teachers want to incorporate more brain science into their mathematics instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to promote learning of mathematics concepts. In this much-needed volume, the authors clearly show what the big ideas are at this grade level, why they are important to know, and how students can best learn those big ideas. </p><p>Filled with engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals, <i>Mindset Mathematics</i> is designed to be flexible so that it can be used with any current curriculum. All of the activities and tasks include instructions for launching in the classroom, suggestions for facilitating dynamic discussions, and guidance for what to look for in student thinking as it develops.</p><p><b>JO BOALER</b> is a professor of mathematics education at Stanford University and co-founder and faculty director of youcubed.

Timothy Gallwey&#x2019;s bestselling <i>Inner Game</i> books&#x2013;with more than one million copies sold&#x2013;have revolutionized the way we think about sports. As he did in his phenomenally successful <i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i>, Gallwey provides methods that can be applied to situations beyond the green. <i>The Inner Game of Golf</i> delivers strategies to achieve potential&#x2013;both in the crucible of competition and in everyday life. With Gallwey as a guide, you&#x2019;ll learn how to<br><br> � defeat your mental demons and find clarity under pressure<br> � dispel tensions that can sabotage your performance<br> � build confidence and overcome insecurities that can hijack your best instincts<br> � employ the art of &#x201c;relaxed concentration&#x201d; to improve your swing, your game, and your life<br><br> No matter what your skill set, Gallwey&#x2019;s pioneering strategies, real-life examples, and illuminating advice are perfect for anyone who strives to be a champion on and off the course.</p><p>Long before Dr. Bob Rotella made tweaking a golfer's head as important as tweaking his swing, Tim Gallwey, who knew virtually nothing about the mechanics of the game when he penned the first edition of this visionary work, understood that even the best technique collapses when the mind cracks under the game's pressure. Gallwey's ultimate insight into the game was that a golfer's mind is a golfer's worst enemy; too much thinking only gets in the way.<p> The new edition of this groundbreaking instructional continues to preach such "Inner Game" fundamentals as trust, concentration, visualization, feel, and relaxation, and is full of what Gallwey calls "awareness exercises." Much of what he has to say seems obvious in a world in which most good athletes have some kind of psychological guru always at the ready to help improve performance, but Gallwey, with his bagful of anecdotes and encouragement, was one of the first to explore this uncharted territory, and still remains one of the most readable. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Barron&#39;s AP Biology Flash Cards, 3rd Edition</h2><p>Revised and updated to reflect the most recent AP Biology test, this set of 450 flash cards covers 20 general categories: About the AP Biology Exam, Biochemistry, The Cell, Cell Division, Cell Respiration, Photosynthesis, Heredity, Molecular Genetics, Biological Diversity, Evolution, Plants, Endocrine System, Immunology, Nerves &amp; Muscles, Reproduction &amp; Development, Ecology, Animal Behavior, Lab Introduction, Lab Review, and Multiple-Choice Questions.<br><br>New to this edition are introductory cards that describe the AP Biology exam in detail and 50 multiple-choice question cards for added practice.

Her first, Music From a Place Called Half Moon. was awarded the Bank Street College Children's Book Award. She lives with her husband in Lexington, Kentucky.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-- At the end of the first day, First Woman tries to convince First Man that ``The people need to know the laws.'' Impatiently, he tells her to write them in the sky. She takes a blanket full of her jewels (stars) and with infinite patience begins ``designing her pattern so all could read it.'' Coyote asks to help, but when he sees the magnitude of the task he grumbles, then flings the remaining stars into the night sky, forever obscuring the pattern. As the second day dawns, the people go about their lives, ``. . . never knowing the reason for the confusion that would always dwell among them.'' This Navajo tale acknowledges the common human feeling that there IS a message in the stars--the laws of a clear and orderly universe--if it could be read. It absolves humans of guilt (Coyote did it) and provides a First Woman who is a strong, positive, and beneficent figure. The concise and graceful text is matched with illustrations in a primitive but dramatic vein, marked by simplified shapes, saturated matte colors, and desert-stark composition. The claret-sandstone earth and deep lapis sky, meeting at a curved horizon, dominate most pages; the white of eyes and starlight punctuate the design. This handsome book might well fit into a myth or Native American collection, but it can stand on its own timely and attractive merits as well.<br><i>- Patricia Dooley, Univ. of Washington Extension, Seattle</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kreutzer - 42 Studies or Caprices: Schirmer Library of Classics Volume 230 Violin Method (Schirmer&#39;s Library of Musical Classics)</h2><p>(String Method).

And while that wouldn&#x2019;t be wrong, it wouldn&#x2019;t begin to tell you the whole story. For example, it wouldn&#x2019;t tell you that, in addition to doing homework and mowing the lawn, my list of chores typically includes solving cases as a consulting detective with the FBI&#x2019;s Special Projects Team.<br> <br>And if you looked at the copy of Albert Einstein&#x2019;s Relativity that was checked out from the Tenley-Friendship branch of the DC Public Library nine days ago, you&#x2019;d think, Science book. (Okay, first you might look at the picture of Einstein on the cover and wonder how he got his hair to look that way, but then you&#x2019;d think, Science book.) However, you&#x2019;d never guess that the book triggered an international incident involving a Russian spy ring, the theft of national treasures, a European crime syndicate, and a joint task force of the FBI, CIA, and National Security Agency.<br> <br>And finally, if you looked at our plan to break into the Library of Congress, evade its state-of-the-art security system, and somehow find the single piece of information necessary to solve our case, you&#x2019;d think my best friend&#x2014;Margaret&#x2014;and I were absolutely bonkers.<br> <br>Okay, so sometimes you can judge a book by its cover.<br> <br>The plan was totally nuts.<br> <br>To be honest, it wasn&#x2019;t so much a plan as it was a list of nearly impossible objectives with no idea how to accomplish them. We knew it was bad. We just couldn&#x2019;t come up with anything better. We had to unmask a spy who&#x2019;d spent decades as a deep-cover agent stealing US government secrets.

Marcus who&#x2019;d spent his entire career fighting criminals was now accused of being one.<br> <br>Desperate times called for desperate measures.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the mastermind,&#x201d; I said to Margaret as we approached the library. &#x201c;What are we going to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get inside, find the evidence, and prove Marcus is innocent,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>I gave her a sideways glance. &#x201c;You have any specific details about how we should do those things?&#x201d;<br> <br>She shrugged. &#x201c;I figured we&#x2019;d just make it up as we went along.&#x201d;<br> <br>Like I said, absolutely bonkers.<br> <br>OBJECTIVE 1:<br> <br>Crash the &#x201c;It&#x2019;s All About the Books&#x201d; Gala at the Library of Congress<br> <br>First, we had to get inside the library by crashing a gala reception in the Great Hall of the Thomas Jefferson Building. When we arrived, there were about fifty people in tuxedos and gowns waiting to pass through security.<br> <br>&#x201c;How are we going to do this?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Clothes and confidence,&#x201d; Margaret answered as if that were a complete sentence.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I looked up &#x2018;crashing a formal party&#x2019; online, and it said the two most important things were clothes and confidence. You&#x2019;ve got to dress like you belong and act like you belong.&#x201d;<br> <br>Between my tuxedo and Margaret&#x2019;s dress, we had the clothes part covered. It was the confidence component that had me worried.<br> <br>&#x201c;Speaking of clothes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Why do you have a tux?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s a formal event,&#x201d; I answered, stating the obvious.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Not why are you wearing it. Why do you have it in the first place? What twelve-year-old owns a tuxedo?&#x201d;<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. &#x201c;Let me get this straight. You&#x2019;re giving me a hard time for having something we need?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not giving you a hard time,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I just think it&#x2019;s a little . . . unusual. Call me curious.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Both my parents work in museums,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been dragged to more fund-raisers and exhibition openings than I can remember. They&#x2019;re usually formal events like this one, so they bought me a tux.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, that makes sense,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s also good news. Since you&#x2019;ve been to a lot of these things, you should fit right in.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s one big difference between those events and this one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We had invitations.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gave me a conspiratorial smile and said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to let a little piece of paper stop us from solving the mystery and saving Marcus, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She always knew what to say to get me to go along with her schemes. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do this.&#x201d;<br> <br>There were two lines with security guards manning metal detectors. At the head of each line was a woman with a computer tablet checking invitations. One of the women looked to be in her mid-twenties and wore a black cocktail dress and very high heels. The other wore a longer dress with shoes that were nice but more comfortable. She also had a wedding band on her ring finger.<br> <br>&#x201c;The odds are better that the one on the right is a mom,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That might mean she&#x2019;s nicer to kids.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; answered Margaret. &#x201c;But the one on the left is more likely to think all kids are stupid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good point,&#x201d; I said as we got into the line on the left.<br> <br>During an FBI training session called Outsmarting Your Opponent, we were taught that the biggest advantage you can have is for the other side to underestimate your abilities.<br> <br>&#x201c;When she asks for our invitations, we&#x2019;ll tell her our moms have them but are already inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If our mothers are inside, then why are we out here?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where the stupid comes in.&#x201d; Margaret suddenly adopted the voice of an airheaded middle schooler who spoke in endless run-on sentences. &#x201c;I was texting my friend Maddie about the party but I had trouble getting good reception so I started walking around trying to get more bars but it just got worse and worse so I went through a door and accidentally got locked outside. OMG, my mom&#x2019;s going to kill me if she finds out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do people really think kids talk that way?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m counting on it,&#x201d; Margaret said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And why am I outside if you were the one on the phone?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re my best friend. You go wherever I go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;re both stupid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the plan unless you&#x2019;ve got a better one,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>I exhaled slowly. &#x201c;Tragically, I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>We were about halfway through the line when she realized we had a potential problem. &#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked nervously.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll probably want a name to check against the guest list. We&#x2019;ll need some TOAST help on that.&#x201d;<br> <br>TOAST stands for the Theory of All Small Things. It is the method we use to read people and situations in order to solve cases. The idea is that if you look for little details, you can add them up to discover otherwise hidden pieces of information. At the moment we needed the names of two potential &#x201c;mothers&#x201d; who were already inside the gala.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got it covered,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>I pulled out my phone and started searching.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looking on social media for any pictures tagged with that.&#x201d; I pointed to a banner that read, #ITSALLABOUTTHEBOOKS.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s kind of brilliant,&#x201d; she said as she did likewise.<br> <br>Even though the party was barely an hour old, there were already dozens of photos to scroll through of people inside having fun.<br> <br>&#x201c;Find one posted by someone with an unusual name,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll seem less likely that we made it up. Also, find out where they work in case that&#x2019;s included on the guest list.&#x201d;<br> <br>By the time we reached the front of the line, we were ready to go. Margaret&#x2019;s airhead act worked like a charm, and when asked, I became the son of a kids&#x2019; book publisher named Mara Anastas. I even spelled it out for her so that she could find it on her tablet.<br> <br>&#x201c;See what I mean,&#x201d; Margaret said as we walked through the entrance. &#x201c;Clothes and confidence.&#x201d;<br> <br>OBJECTIVE 2:<br> <br>Avoid Detection While Sneaking into the Library&#x2019;s Secure Area<br> <br>It was amazing how different the Great Hall looked compared to when we&#x2019;d come during normal hours. Multicolored lights gave it a party feel, and giant reproductions of famous book covers were hung as decorations. People mingled in clusters while a jazz quartet played on a stage.<br> <br>A waiter walked past us carrying a tray of finger food, which caught Margaret&#x2019;s attention. &#x201c;Ooh, those look delicious.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re working a case,&#x201d; I reminded her, &#x201c;not going to a party.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gave me that Margaret smirk. &#x201c;Actually, we&#x2019;re blending in at a party so that we can work the case. Besides, if I pass out from starvation, that will attract even more attention.&#x201d;<br> <br>She chased after the waiter, and I scanned the room. Now that we were inside, we needed to find the computer server. The library had an automated system that kept detailed records of its secure areas. If we could access them, we thought we could prove Marcus&#x2019;s innocence.<br> <br>Margaret returned carrying a little plate with two toothpick skewers of beef. &#x201c;The waiter said it&#x2019;s called bulgogi, and it&#x2019;s amazing,&#x201d; she said as she tasted one. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s Korean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that one for me?&#x201d; I asked, pointing to the untouched skewer.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you said we weren&#x2019;t at a party.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, now I&#x2019;m worried about passing out due to starvation.&#x201d;<br> <br>She reluctantly held up the second skewer, and I snatched it before she could change her mind. It was delicious.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I said between chews. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to track him down and get more.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no, no,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This is not good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean? It tastes great.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not the food,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Him.&#x201d;<br> <br>She nodded over my shoulder, and I turned to see one of our suspects about fifteen feet from us. It was Alistair Toombs, the director of the library&#x2019;s Rare Book and Special Collections Division. Luckily, he was facing the other way. We had a run-in with him earlier during the case and couldn&#x2019;t risk being seen.<br> <br>We worked our way to the opposite side of the room and tried to disappear into the crowd of people milling around chitchatting.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to find the server room fast,&#x201d; I said as I studied the building&#x2019;s layout, trying to logically deduce where it should be. &#x201c;It has to be cool and dry, which means it won&#x2019;t have any exterior walls. Humidity can seep through those. They&#x2019;d also stay away from the lower basement to avoid potential flooding. As far as wiring . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate to interrupt your little Sherlock moment,&#x201d; Margaret said. &#x201c;But it might be quicker if we just follow him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Next to the stage a computer tech was making adjustments to the audio and lighting boards. He looked like he was just out of college. As soon as he was done, he took his tool kit and left.<br> <br>&#x201c;Change of plans,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s follow him.&#x201d;<br> <br>The guy led us back across the room before he got into an elevator labeled STAFF ONLY. After the doors closed, we rushed over to watch the display to see where he got off.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two floors down,&#x201d; said Margaret. &#x201c;Now we&#x2019;re getting somewhere.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, except we&#x2019;re not getting anywhere on that elevator. At least, not without a key card.&#x201d;<br> <br>The call button was attached to a card reader.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not a problem,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll just hang around here until somebody gets off the elevator. Then we&#x2019;ll slip in before the doors shut.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a good plan. At least until Alistair Toombs spotted us. Because we&#x2019;d followed the computer tech, we were no longer hidden in the crowd. I could tell by Toombs&#x2019;s expression that he recognized us. He looked angry and was headed our way.<br> <br>Luckily, at that moment the elevator dinged, and the door opened. We had to wait for a man as he struggled to push an oversized catering cart. We helped him by giving it a tug, and by the time he was finally gone, Toombs had almost reached us. We jumped into the elevator and pushed the buttons as quickly as we could.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait one moment!&#x201d; Toombs called out as the doors finally closed and we began to descend.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going to have much time before he takes the next elevator down and starts chasing us,&#x201d; said Margaret.<br> <br>When the doors opened, we hurried out into the hallway. We didn&#x2019;t want to run because it might attract attention, but we did our best speed walking.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are we looking for?&#x201d; Margaret asked in a hurried whisper.<br> <br>&#x201c;Any place we can hide,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Down here the building showed its age. Over the course of 120 years, it had been built and rebuilt so many times the hallways and storage rooms were mazelike in their complexity. The good part was that that would make it harder for Alistair to find us. The bad part was that it meant it would be difficult for us to find our way around.<br> <br>When we heard the ding announcing the elevator&#x2019;s return, we picked up the pace even more. We just kept making turn after turn until we ran into a dead end. Behind us we could hear Alistair&#x2019;s footsteps in the distance. We had three doors to choose from. Amazingly, one was marked COMPUTERS.<br> <br>Margaret and I shared a smile. Fate had shined on us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Better lucky than smart,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>We slipped into the darkened room as quietly as we could and closed the door tightly behind us. We didn&#x2019;t dare turn on the lights for fear he&#x2019;d be able to see the glow under the door.<br> <br>We could hear him getting closer.<br> <br>More frightening, we could tell that he was trying each door along the way. Most of them were locked, and we heard the rattle of the handles.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do we do?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Hide?&#x201d;<br> <br>Next to the door was a small electronic display that had a keypad and a glowing red button marked LOCK.<br> <br>I pressed it, and we heard a click.<br> <br>I cringed at the sound, hoping it wasn&#x2019;t too loud.<br> <br>We stood silently in the darkness. Through the space underneath the door, we could see a pair of shoes come to a stop. On the other side, Toombs jiggled the handle, but it didn&#x2019;t budge. He tried again, but it still didn&#x2019;t open. Finally he went on his way.<br> <br>We remained motionless for at least two minutes, and all I heard were Margaret&#x2019;s slow, measured breaths.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think it&#x2019;s safe to turn on the lights?&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said tentatively.<br> <br>I found the switch and flipped it. As the lights turned on and my eyes adjusted, I realized that our &#x201c;lucky&#x201d; find wasn&#x2019;t so lucky after all. We weren&#x2019;t in a computer room. We were in a room full of books about computers. This was, after all, the world&#x2019;s largest library. Books were everywhere.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s better to be smart than lucky,&#x201d; I joked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;At least he didn&#x2019;t catch us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Should we keep trying to find the server?&#x201d;<br> <br>Margaret shook her head. &#x201c;No. He&#x2019;s not going to stop looking. Or worse, he&#x2019;ll alert security. I think we&#x2019;ve got to get out of the building before someone catches us. We&#x2019;re not going to be able to help Marcus if we get arrested.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good point.&#x201d;<br> <br>We waited another minute to make sure he was gone, and then I opened the door.<br> <br>Or rather, I turned the handle to open the door, b...</p><h2>The Viva Mayr Diet: 14 Days to a Flatter Stomach and a Younger You</h2><p><b>A glass of wine at dinner and a flatter stomach in 14 days?

However, his nose throbbed painfully, which he thought odd in the circumstances. While he placed considerable trust in the understanding and mercy of his Creator, he harbored that residue of elemental guilt that made all men fear the chance of hell. Still, all he had ever heard of hell made him think it unlikely that the torments reserved for its luckless inhabitants could be restricted to a sore nose.<br><br>On the other hand, this couldn&#x2019;t be heaven, on several counts. For one, he didn&#x2019;t deserve it. For another, it didn&#x2019;t look it. And for a third, he doubted that the rewards of the blessed included a broken nose, any more than those of the damned.<br><br>While he had always thought of Purgatory as a gray sort of place, the faint reddish light that hid everything around him seemed suitable. His mind was clearing a bit, and his power to reason was coming back, if slowly. Someone, he thought rather crossly, ought to see him and tell him just what the sentence was, until he should have suffered enough to be purified, and at last to enter the Kingdom of God. Whether he was expecting a demon or an angel was uncertain. He had no idea of the staffing requirements of Purgatory; it wasn&#x2019;t a matter the dominie had addressed in his schooldays.<br><br>While waiting, he began to take stock of whatever other torments he might be required to endure. There were numerous cuts, gashes, and bruises here and there, and he was fairly sure he&#x2019;d broken the fourth finger of his right hand again&#x2014;difficult to protect it, the way it stuck out so stiff, with the joint frozen. None of that was too bad, though. What else?<br><br>Claire. The name knifed across his heart with a pain that was more racking than anything his body had ever been called on to withstand.<br><br>If he had had an actual body anymore, he was sure it would have doubled up in agony. He had known it would be like this, when he sent her back to the stone circle. Spiritual anguish could be taken as a standard condition in Purgatory, and he had expected all along that the pain of separation would be his chief punishment&#x2014;sufficient, he thought, to atone for anything he&#x2019;d ever done: murder and betrayal included.<br><br>He did not know whether persons in Purgatory were allowed to pray or not, but tried anyway. Lord, he prayed, that she may be safe. She and the child. He was sure she would have made it to the circle itself; only two months gone with child, she was still light and fleet of foot&#x2014;and the most stubbornly determined woman he had ever met. But whether she had managed the dangerous transition back to the place from which she had come&#x2014; sliding precariously through whatever mysterious layers lay between then and now, powerless in the grip of the rock&#x2014;that he could never know, and the thought of it was enough to make him forget even the throbbing in his nose.<br><br>He resumed his interrupted inventory of bodily ills, and became inordinately distressed at the discovery that his left leg appeared to be missing. Sensation stopped at the hip, with a sort of pins-and-needles tingling at the joint. Presumably he would get it back in due time, either when he finally arrived in Heaven, or at the least, at Judgment Day. And after all, his brother-in-law Ian managed very well on the wooden peg he wore to replace his missing leg.<br><br>Still, his vanity was troubled. Ah, that must be it; a punishment meant to cure him of the sin of vanity. He mentally set his teeth, determined to accept whatever came to him with fortitude, and such humility as he could manage. Still, he couldn&#x2019;t help reaching an exploratory hand (or whatever he was using for a hand) tentatively downward, to see just where the limb now ended.<br><br>The hand struck something hard, and the fingers tangled in wet, snarled hair. He sat up abruptly, and with some effort, cracked the layer of dried blood that had sealed his eyelids shut. Memory flooded back, and he groaned aloud. He had been mistaken. This was hell. But James Fraser was unfortunately not dead, after all.<br><br>The body of a man lay across his own. Its dead weight crushed his left leg, explaining the absence of feeling. The head, heavy as a spent cannonball, pressed facedown into his abdomen, the damp-matted hair a dark spill on the wet linen of his shirt. He jerked upward in sudden panic; the head rolled sideways into his lap and a half-open eye stared sightlessly up behind the sheltering strands of hair.<br><br>It was Jack Randall, his fine red captain&#x2019;s coat so dark with the wet it looked almost black. Jamie made a fumbling effort to push the body away, but found himself amazingly weak; his hand splayed feebly against Randall&#x2019;s shoulder, and the elbow of his other arm buckled suddenly as he tried to support himself. He found himself lying once more flat on his back, the sleeting sky pale gray and whirling dizzily overhead. Jack Randall&#x2019;s head moved obscenely up and down on his stomach with each gasping breath.<br><br>He pressed his hands flat against the boggy ground&#x2014;the water rose up cold through his fingers and soaked the back of his shirt&#x2014;and wriggled sideways. Some warmth was trapped between them; as the limp dead weight slid slowly free, the freezing rain struck his newly exposed flesh with a shock like a blow, and he shivered violently with sudden chill.<br><br>As he squirmed on the ground, struggling with the crumpled, mudstained folds of his plaid, he could hear sounds above the keening of the April wind; far-off shouts and a moaning and wailing, like the calling of ghosts in the wind. And overall, the raucous calling of crows. Dozens of crows, from the sound.<br><br>That was strange, he thought dimly. Birds shouldn&#x2019;t fly in a storm like this. A final heave freed the plaid from under him, and he fumbled it over his body. As he reached to cover his legs, he saw that his kilt and left leg were soaked with blood. The sight didn&#x2019;t distress him; it seemed only vaguely interesting, the dark red smears a contrast to the grayish green of the moor plants around him. The echoes of battle faded from his ears, and he left Culloden Field to the calling of the crows.<br><br>He was wakened much later by the calling of his name.<br><br>&#x201c;Fraser! Jamie Fraser! Are ye here?&#x201d;<br><br>No, he thought groggily. I&#x2019;m not. Wherever he had been while unconscious, it was a better place than this. He lay in a small declivity, half-filled with water. The sleeting rain had stopped, but the wind hadn&#x2019;t; it whined over the moor, piercing and chilling. The sky had darkened nearly to black; it must be near evening, then.<br><br>&#x201c;I saw him go down here, I tell ye. Right near a big clump of gorse.&#x201d; The voice was at a distance, fading as it argued with someone.<br><br>There was a rustle near his ear, and he turned his head to see the crow. It stood on the grass a foot away, a blotch of wind-ruffled black feathers, regarding him with a bead-bright eye. Deciding that he posed no threat, it swiveled its neck with casual ease and jabbed its thick sharp bill into Jack Randall&#x2019;s eye.<br><br>Jamie jerked up with a cry of revulsion and a flurry of movement that sent the crow flapping off, squawking with alarm.<br><br>&#x201c;Ay! Over there!&#x201d;<br><br>There was a squelching through boggy ground, and a face before him, and the welcome feel of a hand on his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s alive! Come on, MacDonald! D&#x2019;ye lend a hand here; he&#x2019;ll no be walkin&#x2019; on his own.&#x201d; There were four of them, and with a good deal of effort, they got him up, arms draped helpless about the shoulders of Ewan Cameron and Iain MacKinnon.<br><br>He wanted to tell them to leave him; his purpose had returned to him with the waking, and he remembered that he had meant to die. But the sweetness of their company was too much to resist. The rest had restored the feeling in his dead leg, and he knew the seriousness of the wound. He would die soon in any case; thank God that it need not be alone, in the dark.<br><br>&#x201c;Water?&#x201d; The edge of the cup pressed against his lip, and he roused himself long enough to drink, careful not to spill it. A hand pressed briefly against his forehead and dropped away without comment.<br><br>He was burning; he could feel the flames behind his eyes when he closed them. His lips were cracked and sore from the heat, but it was better than the chills that came at intervals. At least when he was fevered, he could lie still; the shaking of the chills woke the sleeping demons in his leg.<br><br>Murtagh. He had a terrible feeling about his godfather, but no memory to give it shape. Murtagh was dead; he knew that must be it, but didn&#x2019;t know why or how he knew. A good half of the Highland army was dead, slaughtered on the moor&#x2014;so much he had gathered from the talk of the men in the farmhouse, but he had no memory of the battle himself.<br><br>He had fought with armies before, and knew such loss of memory was not uncommon in soldiers; he had seen it, though never before suffered it himself. He knew the memories would come back, and hoped he would be dead before they did. He shifted at the thought, and the movement sent a jolt of white-hot pain through his leg that made him groan.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, Jamie?&#x201d; Ewan rose on one elbow next to him, worried face wan in the dawning light. A bloodstained bandage circled his head, and there were rusty stains on his collar, from the scalp wound left by a bullet&#x2019;s graze.<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, I&#x2019;ll do.&#x201d; He reached up a hand and touched Ewan&#x2019;s shoulder in gratitude. Ewan patted it, and lay back down.<br><br>The crows were back. Black as night themselves, they had gone to roost with the darkness, but with the dawn they were back&#x2014;birds of war, the corbies had come to feast on the flesh of the fallen. It could as well be his own eyes the cruel beaks picked out, he thought. He could feel the shape of his eyeballs beneath his lids, round and hot, tasty bits of jelly rolling restless to and fro, looking vainly for oblivion, while the rising sun turned his lids a dark and bloody red.<br><br>Four of the men were gathered near the single window of the farmhouse, talking quietly together.<br><br>&#x201c;Make a run for it?&#x201d; one said, with a nod outside. &#x201c;Christ, man, the best of us can barely stagger&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s six at least canna walk at all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If ye can go, be going,&#x201d; said a man from the floor. He grimaced toward his own leg, wrapped in the remains of a tattered quilt. &#x201c;Dinna linger on our account.&#x201d;<br><br>Duncan MacDonald turned from the window with a grim smile, shaking his head. The window&#x2019;s light shone off the rough planes of his face, deepening the lines of fatigue.<br><br>&#x201c;Nay, we&#x2019;ll bide,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;For one thing, the English are thick as lice on the ground; ye can see them swarm from the window. There&#x2019;s no man would get away whole from Drumossie now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even those that fled the field yesterday will no get far,&#x201d; MacKinnon put in softly. &#x201c;Did ye no hear the English troops passing in the night at the quick-march? D&#x2019;ye think it will be hard for them to hunt down our ragtag lot?&#x201d;<br><br>There was no response to this; all of them knew the answer too well. Many of the Highlanders had been barely able to stand on the field before the battle, weakened as they were by cold, fatigue, and hunger.<br><br>Jamie turned his face to the wall, praying that his men had started early enough. Lallybroch was remote; if they could get far enough from Culloden, it was unlikely they would be caught. And yet Claire had told him that Cumberland&#x2019;s troops would ravage the Highlands, ranging far afield in their thirst for revenge.<br><br>The thought of her this time caused only a wave of terrible longing. God, to have her here, to lay her hands on him, to tend his wounds and cradle his head in her lap. But she was gone&#x2014;gone away two hundred years from him &#x2014;and thank the Lord that she was! Tears trickled slowly from under his closed lids, and he rolled painfully onto his side, to hide them from the others.<br><br>Lord, that she might be safe, he prayed. She and the child.<br><br>Toward midafternoon, the smell of burning came suddenly on the air, wafting through the glassless window. It was thicker than the smell of blackpowder smoke, pungent, with an underlying odor that was faintly horrible in its reminiscent smell of roasting meat.<br><br>&#x201c;They are burning the dead,&#x201d; said MacDonald. He had scarcely moved from his seat by the window in all the time they had been in the cottage. He looked like a death&#x2019;s-head himself, hair coal-black and matted with dirt, scraped back from a face in which every bone showed.<br><br>Here and there, a small, flat crack sounded on the moor. Gunshots. The coups de grace, administered by those English officers with a sense of compassion, before a tartan-clad wretch should be stacked on the pyre with his luckier fellows. When Jamie looked up, Duncan MacDonald still sat by the window, but his eyes were closed.<br><br>Next to him, Ewan Cameron crossed himself. &#x201c;May we find as much mercy,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br>They did. It was just past noon on the second day when booted feet at last approached the farmhouse, and the door swung open on silent leather hinges.<br><br>&#x201c;Christ.&#x201d; It was a muttered exclamation at the sight within the farmhouse. The draft from the door stirred the fetid air over grimed, bedraggled, bloodstained bodies that lay or sat huddled on the packed-dirt floor.<br><br>There had been no discussion of the possibility of armed resistance; they had no heart and there was no point. The Jacobites simply sat, waiting the pleasure of their visitor.<br><br>He was a major, all fresh and new in an uncreased uniform, with polished boots. After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation to survey the inhabitants, he stepped inside, his lieutenant close behind.<br><br>&#x201c;I am Lord Melton,&#x201d; he said, glancing around as though seeking the leader of these men, to whom his remarks might most properly be addressed.<br><br>Duncan MacDonald, after a glance of his own, stood slowly, and inclined his head. &#x201c;Duncan MacDonald, of Glen Richie,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And others&#x201d;&#x2014;he waved a hand&#x2014;&#x201c;late of the forces of His Majesty, King James.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So I surmised,&#x201d; the Englishman said dryly. He was young, in his early thirties, but he carried himself with a seasoned soldier&#x2019;s confidence. He looked deliberately from man to man, then reached into his coat and produced a folded sheet of paper.</p><h2>The Real Book (B Flat, Sixth edition)</h2><p>(Fake Book).

Tens of millions of people in business, government, and schools have dramatically improved their lives and organizations by applying the principles of Stephen R. Covey&#x2019;s classic book.<br> <br>The world, however, is a vastly changed place. Being effective as individuals and organizations is no longer merely an option&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a requirement for survival. But in order to thrive, innovate, excel, and lead in what Covey calls the &#x201c;New Knowledge Worker Age,&#x201d; we must build on and move beyond effectiveness. In this era of human history, our call is for greatness&#x2014;holistic fulfillment, passionate execution, and significant contribution.<br> <br>Accessing the higher levels of human genius in today&#x2019;s new reality requires a change in thinking: a new mindset and a new skill-set&#x2014;in short, a new habit. The crucial challenge of our world today is this: to find our voice and inspire others to find theirs. It is what Covey calls the 8th Habit. <i>The 8th Habit</i> is the answer to the soul&#x2019;s yearning for greatness, the organization&#x2019;s imperative for significance and superior results, and humanity&#x2019;s search for its &#x201c;voice.&#x201d;<br> <br>Covey&#x2019;s books have transformed the way we think about ourselves, our purpose in life, our organizations, and about humankind. Just as <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> helped us focus on effectiveness, <i>The 8th Habit </i>shows us the way to greatness.</p><p>Recognized as one of <i>Time</i> magazine&#x2019;s twenty-five most influential Americans, Stephen R. Covey (1932&#x2013;2012) was an internationally respected leadership authority, family expert, teacher, organizational consultant, and author.&nbsp;His books have sold more than twenty-five million copies&nbsp;in thirty-eight languages, and <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> was named the #1 Most Influential Business Book of the Twentieth Century. After receiving an MBA from Harvard and a doctorate degree from Brigham Young University, he became the cofounder and vice chairman of FranklinCovey, a leading global training firm.<b>Chapter 3: The Solution</b><blockquote><p><i>There is nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come.</i></p><p>Victor Hugo</p></blockquote><p>Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."1 This book is dedicated to striking at the root of the significant problems we face.</p><p>We've started with the <i>pain;</i> we've explored the underlying <i>problem</i> -- one that has personal roots and that involves a deeply imbedded paradigm and set of traditions in the workplace. Now let's set the context for the <i>solution</i> and give an overview of how it will be unfolded in the remainder of the book.</p><p>I've worked with organizations around the world for over forty years and have been a student of the findings of the great minds who have studied organizations. Most of the great cultural shifts -- ones that have built great organizations that <i>sustain</i> long-term growth, prosperity and contribution to the world -- started with the choice of <i>one</i> person. Sometimes that one person was the formal leader -- the CEO or president. Very often it <i>started</i> with someone else -- a professional, a line manager, someone's assistant. Regardless of their position, these people first changed themselves from the <i>inside out.</i> Their character, competence, initiative and positive energy -- in short, their moral authority -- inspired and lifted others. They possessed an anchored sense of identity, discovered their strengths and talents, and used them to meet needs and produce results. People noticed. They were given more responsibility. They magnified the new responsibility and again produced results. More and more people sat up and noticed. Top people wanted to learn of their ideas -- how they accomplished <i>so much.</i> The culture was drawn to their vision and to them.</p><p>People like this just don't get sucked into or pulled down for long by all the negative, demoralizing, insulting forces in the organization. And interestingly, their organizations are no better than most organizations. To some degree, they're <i>all</i> a mess. These people just realize that they can't wait for their boss or the organization to change. They become an island of excellence in a sea of mediocrity. And it's contagious.</p><p>Where does a person get such internal strength to swim against the current and to withstand negative cultural provocations, subordinate selfish interests and develop and sustain such vision and determination?</p><p>They learn of their true nature and gifts. They use them to develop a vision of great things they want to accomplish. With wisdom they take initiative and cultivate great understanding of the needs and opportunities around them. They meet those needs that match their unique talents, that tap their higher motivations and that make a difference. In short, <i>they find and use their voice.</i> They serve and inspire others. They apply PRINCIPLES that govern growth and prosperity in human beings AND in organizations -- principles that draw the highest and best from a "whole person" -- body, mind, heart and spirit. Equally significant, they also choose to influence and <i>inspire others to find their voice</i> through these principles as well.</p><p>This two-part solution -- <i>Find Your Voice</i> and <i>Inspire Others to Find Theirs</i> -- is a road map for individuals at ANY level of an organization to maximize their fulfillment and influence, become an irreplaceable contributor, and inspire their team and the broader organization to do the same. Accordingly, the book is organized into two main sections:</p><p></p><blockquote>1. Find Your Voice<p>2. Inspire Others to Find Their Voice</p></blockquote><p>Let's briefly introduce each.</p><p><b>Find Your Voice</b></p><p>Everyone chooses one of two roads in life -- the old and the young, the rich and the poor, men and women alike. One is the broad, well-traveled road to mediocrity, the other the road to greatness and meaning. The range of possibilities that exists within each of these two destinations is as wide as the diversity of gifts and personalities in the human family. But the contrast between the two destinations is as the night is to the day.</p><p>The path to mediocrity straitjackets human potential. The path to greatness unleashes and realizes human potential. The path to mediocrity is the quick-fix, short-cut approach to life. The path to greatness is a process of sequential growth from the inside out. Travelers on the lower path to mediocrity live out the <i>cultural "software"</i> of ego, indulgence, scarcity, comparison, competitiveness and victimism. Travelers on the upper path to greatness rise above negative cultural influences and choose to become the creative force of their lives. One word expresses the pathway to greatness. Voice. Those on this path find their voice and inspire others to find theirs. The rest never do.</p><p><b>The Soul's Search for Meaning</b></p><p>Deep within each one of us there is an inner longing to live a life of <i>greatness</i> and contribution -- to really matter, to really make a difference. We may doubt ourselves and our ability to do so, but I want you to know of my deep conviction that <i>you can</i> live such a life. You have the potential within you. We all do. It is the birthright of the human family.</p><p>I once visited with the commander of a military base who was truly on fire with his commitment to undertake a significant cultural change inside his organization. He had been in the service for over thirty years, was a full colonel, and was eligible for retirement that very year. After he had been teaching and training his organization for many months I asked him why he planned to stay on and undertake such a major initiative -- one that would require swimming upstream against the tremendous resisting forces of tradition, lethargy, indifference and low trust. I even said to him, "You could relax. You'd have a good retirement. Award banquets would be held in your honor. Loved ones and associates would celebrate you."</p><p>He became very sober, paused for a long time and then decided to share with me a very personal, almost sacred, experience. He said that his father had recently passed away. When the father was on his deathbed, he called his wife and son (the colonel) to him to say good-bye. He could barely speak. His wife wept during the entire visit; the son drew down close to his father, and his father whispered into his ear, "Son, don't do life like I did. I didn't do right by you or by your mother and never really made a difference. Son, promise me you won't do life like I did."</p><p>Those were the last words the colonel heard from his father, who passed away shortly thereafter. But he regarded them as the greatest gift and legacy his father could have ever given him. He made his mind up then and there that he was going to make a difference -- in every area of his life.</p><p>Later the colonel told me privately that he <i>had</i> been planning to retire and relax. In fact, he had secretly hoped that his successor would not do as well as he had and that this would be obvious and apparent to all. But when he had this epiphany with his father, he determined not only to become a change catalyst in building principles of enduring leadership into the culture of his command but also to see to it that his successor would be more successful than he had been. By striving to institutionalize these leadership principles into the structures, systems and processes of his organization, he would increase the likelihood of passing on his legacy one leader-generation to another.</p><p>He said further, that up until that experience with his father, he had knowingly taken the easier road, acting basically in a custodial role in the traditions of the past, and that he had chosen a life of mediocrity. But with his father, he resolved, as never before, to live a life of greatness, a life of real contribution, a life of significance -- one that really made a difference.</p><p>All of us can consciously decide to leave behind a life of mediocrity and to live a life of greatness -- at home, at work and in the community. No matter what our circumstances may be, such a decision can be made by every one of us -- whether that greatness is manifest by choosing to have a magnificent spirit in facing an incurable disease, by simply making a difference in the life of a child, giving that child a sense of worth and potential, by becoming a change-catalyst inside an organization, or by becoming an initiator of a great cause in society. We all have the power to decide to live a <i>great</i> life, or even simpler, to have not only a good day but a <i>great</i> day. No matter how long we've walked life's pathway to mediocrity, we can always choose to switch paths. Always. It's never too late. We can find our voice.</p><p>Once you make the choice to follow this "road less traveled," the pathway to finding your own voice is to:</p><p></p><blockquote><b>1. Discover Your Voice</b> by coming to understand your true nature -- what I call three magnificent birth-gifts (chapter 4) and by developing and using with integrity the intelligence tied to each of the four parts of your nature.<p><b>2. Express Your Voice</b> by cultivating the highest manifestations of these human intelligences -- vision, discipline, passion and conscience (chapter 5).</p></blockquote><p><b>Film: <i>Discovery of a Character</i></b></p><p>I would like to share with you a powerful, true story that embodies this process of finding your voice. Several years ago, our firm participated with our local PBS station in broadcasting a video dramatization we developed and filmed in England. The central figure in this remarkable story is an Englishman who transcended a childhood spent as a street urchin to become a reasonably successful writer with a nice home and a loving family. At the time of the story, however, he had developed "writer's block." It seemed his creativity had turned off. His debts were mounting. He was under tremendous deadline pressure from the publisher. He was becoming more and more depressed. He began to fear that his own children would end up on the streets like ...</p></p><h2>Turning Pages: My Life Story</h2><p><b>Handpicked by Amazon kids&#x2019; books editor, Seira Wilson, for Prime Book Box &#x2013; a children&#x2019;s subscription that inspires a love of reading.</b><br><br><b>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor tells her own story for young readers for the very first time!</b><br><br>As the first Latina Supreme Court Justice, Sonia Sotomayor has inspired young people around the world to reach for their dreams.

Christians claim to follow Him. Muslims honor Him as a prophet. And many Jewish rabbis regard him as a great teacher. Everyone knows about Jesus, but how many of us fully understand what He was like as a person?<br><br>In <i>Love Walked among Us</i>, Paul Miller invites us to get to know Jesus, to observe his life and His love as they unfold in the Gospel narratives. The book investigates such questions as: How do you love someone when you get no love in return, only withdrawal or ingratitude? How do you love without being trapped or used by another person? How do you love when you have your own problems? When do you take care of yourself? When you are compassionate, people use you, but when you are honest, people get angry&#x2015;so how do you love with both compassion and honesty? In every way, Jesus&#x2019; life exemplifies the full potential of what we were intended to be. And the better we know Him, the more we will be drawn to follow His perfect example.</p><p>&#x201c;I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene. Jesus is too colossal for the pen of phrase-mongers, however artful. No man can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life.&#x201d; -Albert Einstein Who Is Jesus? His name is recognized the world over. Christians claim to follow him. Muslims honor him as a prophet. And many Jewish rabbis regard him as a great teacher. Everyone knows about Jesus, but how many of us fully understand what he was like as a person? Nowhere was the vitality of Jesus more visible than in his love, a love unlike any the world has ever seen. Compassionate, honest, powerful, humble, and sacrificial-Jesus was love personified, love walking among us. Such an example doesn&#x2019;t just happen. How did he do it? And how can we learn to love like him? In Love Walked Among Us, Paul Miller invites us to get to know Jesus, to observe his life and his love as they unfold in the gospel narratives. The accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John-combined with Miller&#x2019;s own life stories-will encourage us to imitate Jesus&#x2019; way of loving people. We&#x2019;ll investigate such questions as: - How do you love someone when you get no love in return, only withdrawal or ingratitude? - How do you love without being trapped or used by another person? - How do you love when you have your own problems? When do you take care of yourself? - When you are compassionate, people use you; but when you are honest, people get angry. So how do you love with both compassion and honesty? In every way, Jesus&#x2019; life exemplifies the full potential of what we were intended to be. And the better we know him, the more we will be drawn to follow his perfect example.Paul spent his childhood in California and Oregon, moving east when his father, Dr. Jack Miller, began teaching at Westminster Seminary. After graduating from college, Paul taught at inner-city Christian schools in Philadelphia for ten years. With a group of parents, he started Spruce Hill Christian School (K-8), an inner-city, multiracial school where he was principal and teacher.<br><br>In 1983, he helped his father found World Harvest Mission, serving as associate director from 1983 until 1996. In 1999, he completed a master of divinity at Biblical Seminary and founded seeJesus, a mission that helps Christians and non-Christians alike &#x201c;see Jesus&#x201d; through inductive Bible studies. <br><br>During his time at World Harvest, Paul wrote several discipling courses, including a course on grace called Sonship. In the early '90s, Paul wrote The Love Course, which studies the personality of Jesus as a way of learning to love. In 2001, Paul wrote Love Walked Among Us (NavPress), weaving stories of how Jesus loves together with stories of his own struggles to love. The book is based on The Person of Jesus study, an in-depth, inductive Bible study of what Jesus is like as a person. Both the book and the study are written to include non-Christians who have no background in Christianity. <br><br>In 2005, Paul&#x2019;s A Praying Life study (formerly PrayerLife), an eleven-week course on prayer for &#x201c;badly praying Christians,&#x201d; was released. In 2009, Paul wrote A Praying Life (NavPress), in which the principles in the study are combined with Paul's own stories of learning to live through prayer. In 2011, Paul wrote Ruth: Love Redefined, a study on the book of Ruth.<br><br>Paul is married to Jill, who is known for her sense of humor and faith. They have six children and nine grandchildren, and live in the Philadelphia area.<br></p><h2>Love Must Be Tough: New Hope for Marriages in Crisis</h2><p>You've forgiven a thousand times.

He is the author of the popular <i>Dear Mrs. LaRue</i>, <i>Firehouse!</i>, and <i>Jack and the Beanstalk and the French Fries</i>. He lives in New York State.This eighth entry (counting the two board books) in the Yolen/Teague How Do Dinosaurs series features a cast of 10 brightly colored dinosaurs that manage to dominate the double-page spreads without overwhelming them. Questions arise when the dinos are put in common school-day situations. Would dinosaurs walk to school or carpool? Would they stomp and make a fuss on the bus? Would they roughhouse and punch and disrupt the class by yelling or fidgeting with their tails in the air? Of course not. Before they leap out the door at the end of the school day, readers will realize that these dinosaurs are helpful, tidy, and protective, "growling at the bullies till the bullying ends." Yolen's short, rhyming text and Teague's irresistible, cavorting dinosaurs perfectly convey how dinosaurs could behave in school, large and powerful though they may be. Fans of the other titles in the series will welcome this new lesson on how to behave properly yet manage to remain a true dinosaur. <i>Randall Enos</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I&#x2019;ve heard they hurt, so I pull on the jeans and yank the hoodie on over the T-shirt I slept in. I feel haphazard. On the verge of puking again.

We&#x2019;ve already left our neighborhood and are speeding along Culver. The street is eerie without the usual traffic. It&#x2019;s misty nighttime, but there are so many lights along the road, it&#x2019;s like daylight. We drive past block after block of curving sidewalks lined with hedges and trees and long-leafed plants. Perfectly trimmed, always. When we moved here, that seemed nice. There weren&#x2019;t chain-link fences or alleyways scattered with trash. Everything was clean and green. And there was room. But we&#x2019;ve been living here over three years, and I still get turned around when I go more than a few blocks.

Based on a science once used by the ancient Egyptians, this in-depth but surprisingly simple fortune-telling system is a unique combination of astrology and numerology that can be mastered in a matter of hours. </p> <p>Robert Lee Camp is known throughout Hollywood for his accurate and insightful celebrity readings. Now, try his unique method for yourself and unlock the mysteries of your finances, career, travel, health, and personal relationships. Featuring new articles for advanced study, this book will help you find the answers to questions such as:</p> <p>�When will I have the Millionaire's Spread?<br> �When will I meet someone new or get married?<br> �When will I reach the pinnacle of success at work?<br> �When will be a good time to sell my house?<br> �Which people will be the most beneficial to me in the coming year?</p> <p>Find Your Birth Card Now</p> <p><em>Cards of Your Destiny</em> is a guide to help you better understand how and why you create your life the way you do. This system is the key to unlocking the secrets of your past, present, and future.</p></p><p>Fifteen years ago, Robert Camp discovered an ancient method of determining people&#39;s destinies. He has written five books revealing the secrets of the forecasting science featured in Cards of Your Destiny. He also does personal readings for well-known celebrities, teaches seminars and frequently appears on television and radio talk shows. His other book, Love Cards, is also published by Sourcebooks.<p>In 1973, a man by the name of Arne Lein made an amazing and startling prediction. Arne Lein studied astrology, numerology, and the science of the cards and had many television and motion picture personalities among his clients. By chance, he was asked by Tennis Illustrated magazine to test his system of prediction by deciding who would be the winners of the Wimbledon tennis matches for that year. As Arne began his study of all the contenders, he discovered a fascinating pattern emerging. He noticed that the cards of all the American contenders were showing very bad results for the date of the matches. Their cards showed frustration and disappointment, usually associated with losing matches. Trusting in his system, Arne told Tennis Illustrated that none of the Americans would win those matches or even do well. This was unusual since so many of the top contenders were American. As the date of the matches drew near, a political issue came up whereby none of the Americans were allowed to compete in the matches that year. Tennis Illustrated was stunned that Arne's prediction had come true. So much so, in fact, that they asked him to write a monthly astrology column, which, as you can imagine, is unusual for a tennis magazine. The techniques that Arne Lein used to make his predictions are the very same that you are about to learn while reading this book. Arne Lein was one of my first teachers in the cards, and I pass on to you this ancient and amazing science of forecasting that I have used successfully in my reading practice for the past eight years. It is the most accurate and easy to learn system I have ever found. Prepare yourself to be amazed at the information you will obtain from it. I certainly was and still am.</p> <p>What you are about to learn is part of an ancient esoteric science that has been kept secret for centuries. Mystical orders that have been in existence since before ancient Egypt have carefully preserved its secrets totally intact to be released to the public when the time was right. This is the first book to completely unveil these secrets and to show you, in great detail, how to use this fortune-telling system to learn everything about your past, present, or future. You are among the first to discover and use the power of this ancient system, which is the original science associated with our common playing cards.</p> <p>Inside, you will first discover what your Birth Card is. Once you know what this card is, you will be able to look up any year of your life and read the cards of your Yearly Spreads, which give specific and detailed information about every important area of your life. You will be able to know, in advance, what will be happening in the areas of love, romance, family, work, finances, health, travel, legal matters, and your spiritual life. You will know what are the best times for marriage, business expansion, changing jobs or lines of work, travel, and the sale of real estate. You will be able to see what is going to happen between you and anyone else that you know. People you know will be mentioned in your cards by their exact birthday. The essential nature of all your relationships will be fully explained, both on a lifelong basis and for the year ahead.</p> <p>This book will guide you through the simple steps of doing a complete one-year reading for yourself. This one-year reading has specific information concerning each month of the year. In addition to this, you will learn how to do a weekly reading that shows you the influences present for every day of the week. With these two tools, you will have a valuable guide to help you make all your important decisions. Again, you can also use what you learn to do readings for anyone you choose. Many people have turned this science into a fulltime career. Just as Arne Lein did, you will be able to make predictions about anyone for any purpose. Its knowledge can be applied to business or personal matters with great success.</p> <p>This system is unique. Though it involves our common playing cards, you do not need a deck of cards to do a yearly reading, nor will you need any psychic power. All the cards that represent the events and relationships of every month and year of your life are already chosen for you and ready to be looked up in this book. It is like the fabled and mysterious book of destiny that so many ancient myths allude to. You will actually find a record of your entire life within this book. Whether you care to look into the future or the past, the information is here. All you have to learn is where to look it up and how to interpret the language of the cards. The meanings of all the cards are included so that you can easily translate your cards into information you can use. To do a reading for yourself or anyone else you only need know three bits of information-1) birth date, 2) sex, and 3) occupation.</p> <p>With this information alone, you will be able to access information that is both pertinent and practical. Unlike astrology, you do not need the place or time of birth.</p> <p>Anyone can learn and use this method to advantage-both novices and professionals. If you are new to forecasting techniques, this system will give you some basics of astrology and numerology that will expand your overall comprehension of those subjects. This system is a magical combination of the cards, astrology, and numerology that can be learned quickly and easily. If you have tried other systems, you will find this technique easy to understand and apply. The average person can begin doing readings within hours of beginning this book. Compare that to the years it takes most people to learn the art of astrological predictions. If you have studied numerology or astrology, you will find that your previous studies will add to your comprehension of this "science" and accelerate your mastery of it.</p> <p>But how specific and accurate is the information? Most people who learn it are surprised by its uncanny accuracy-how it names specific people and dates for events, often pinpointing exactly what will happen and with whom. I have found that this system is 100 percent accurate. This I have discovered after years of using and studying it. The more you use it, the more accurate it becomes because your comprehension of it increases. In the beginning, you will find it pinpointing specific events in an amazing way. Later, as you become more experienced at using it, you will see that it also shows you the hidden influences that are behind the external manifestations in your life. Its value as a guide for life decisions increases each time you use it.</p> <p>After using this method for a while, you will find that it offers other benefits you probably were not expecting. Because this system has its roots in some of our oldest mystical orders, the information it provides can be a spiritual guide to help you better understand how and why you create your life the way you do. In a way, this book is a gateway to an entire philosophy of material and spiritual attainment, a philosophy sustained by one of the oldest spiritual fellowships in existence-The Order of the Magi. As you study the meanings of your cards each year, you will find that you have opportunities to alter the course of your destiny. The card meanings will provide you with alternative approaches to the situations that arise in your life and will suggest how to get the greatest good from them. Difficulties can often be avoided through approaching the situation with the right attitude. For example, knowing in advance when the influences are favorable for expansion of your finances and business interests will give you the green light to move forward with confidence. The same principle will increase your successes in your romantic life. Using this system is sort of like driving at night with your headlights on. With your lights on, you can see in advance what is ahead of you and make the proper adjustments in your course to arrive quickly and safely at your destination.</p> <p>In the next chapters, you will begin your study by learning about the cards which represent you-your Birth Card, Planetary Ruling Card, and Personality Cards. Next, using the charts provided, you will learn how to use and interpret the Yearly Spreads of yourself and your friends. Later, this book will teach you how to do weekly readings using a simple but advanced technique of interpreting the spreads. Both beginners and experts will benefit from the detailed interpretations of every card found within.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy using this system and discover for yourself just how amazing and fun it is to use. We offer many forms of support and instruction for those who are interested. There are audio and video tapes, computer software packages, and classes you can take if you decide you want or need further clarification or instruction. Look in the back of the book for more information on these products and services. In the meantime, enjoy using a system that was once only used by the high priests in ancient mystical orders. The truth is for all to share and use, especially now, in our awakening Age of Aquarius.</p> <p>Best wishes, Robert Lee Camp </p> <p></p></p><h2>Genius: A guide to your Activation Sequence (1) (Gene Keys Golden Path)</h2><p>Those of us who are privileged enough to have time to contemplate our purpose have a special responsibility to the earth to bring this essence into the world.

This picture book captures the poetry and magic of the event with a poetry of its own: lyrical words and lovely paintings that present the detail, daring, and--in two dramatic foldout spreads-- the vertiginous drama of Petit's feat.</p><p><i>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers</i> is the winner of the 2004 Caldecott Medal, the winner of the 2004 Boston Globe - Horn Book Award for Picture Books, and the winner of the 2006 Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Children's Video.</p></p><p><b>Mordicai Gerstein</b> is the author and illustrator of <i>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers</i>, winner of the Caldecott Medal, and has had four books named <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated Books of the Year. His works include <i>The Boy and the Whale</i>, <i>How to Bicycle to the Moon to Plant Sunflowers</i>, and illustrations for <i>Applesauce Season</i>.In 1974, Philippe Petit, a French aerialist and street performer, disguised himself as a construction worker and shot a strong wire from one tower of the World Trade Center to the other. In a death-defying dance, Petit crossed the 140 feet between the towers, a quarter of a mile above New York City. Petit was arrested and sentenced to perform for children in the parks. Gerstein's reading is congenial and disarming. His images are spare yet lyrical, magical and poetic; his performance, completely engaging. His understated delivery captures Petit's playful nature, his delight in imagining himself in the space between the towers, and his satisfaction at achieving the impossible. The closing somber words, "Now the towers are gone," create an indelible memory, part joy, part grief.

But do you have any idea how the age-old tale of the Spider and the Fly ends? Join celebrated artist Tony DiTerlizzi as he -- drawing inspiration from one of his loves, the classic Hollywood horror movies of the 1920s and 1930s -- shines a cinematic spotlight on Mary Howitt's warning, written to her own children about those who use sweet words to hide their not-so-sweet intentions.</p><p><b>Mary Howitt</b> was born in Gloucestershire, England, in 1799. With her husband, William Howitt, she wrote more than 180 books, including the poem <i>The Spider and the Fly: An Apologue: A New Version of an Old Story</i>, which first appeared in <i>The New Year&#x2019;s Gift</i>.<br><br>Tony DiTerlizzi is a <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and illustrator who has been creating books with Simon &amp; Schuster for fifteen years. From his fanciful picture books like <i>Jimmy Zangwow&#x2019;s Out-of-this-World Moon Pie Adventure</i>, <i>Adventure of Meno</i> (with his wife, Angela), and <i>The Spider &amp; The Fly</i> (a Caldecott Honor book), to chapter books like <i>Kenny and The Dragon</i> and <i>The Search for WondLa</i>, Tony always imbues his stories with a rich imagination. His middle grade series, The Spiderwick Chronicles (with Holly Black), has sold millions of copies, been adapted into a feature film, and has been translated in more than thirty countries. You can visit him at DiTerlizzi.com.Howitt's 1829 cautionary poem of a fly's risky entanglement with her perfidious predator springs to cinematic life amid silver-sheened black-and-white illustrations by an artist well known for his work on the Magic: The Gathering trading cards. Gouache images that seem to glow in the dark deftly recall the silent film era, craftily luring in readers even before the tale's famous opener, " `Will you walk into my parlor?' said the Spider to the Fly." An exterior view of a darkened mansion, its sole light coming from an attic window, gives way to a close-up of the same window as a petite dragonfly in flapper attire (complete with fringed dress, long gloves and flower-petal parasol) peers inside at Spider's lair: a Victorian dollhouse set amid cobwebby attic treasures. With an arsenal of Vincent Price expressions, the well-heeled Spider uses food and flattery to entice his guest into staying within his walls. Some of the text appears periodically against a framed black backdrop, ... la silent movie captions, while a silvery web is progressively woven in the background. Finely detailed scenes foreshadow Fly's demise with subtle, Charles Addams-esque humor that, while it may escape younger readers, will tickle the Lemony Snicket set. (In one scene, previous insect victims, now ghosts with their feet hovering above the floor, hold up a copy of The Joy of Cooking Bugs, in a vain warning to Fly.) DiTerlizzi has spun a visual treat that young sophisticates and adults alike will enjoy.

She lives in Santa Monica.&nbsp;Hello, Sunshine 1<p></p> <br>You should probably know two things up front. And the first is this: On my thirty-fifth birthday&#x2014;the day I lost my career and my husband and my home in one uncompromising swoop&#x2014;I woke up to one of my favorite songs playing on the radio alarm clock. I woke up to &#x201c;Moonlight Mile&#x201d; playing on the radio (where it is almost never played) and actually thought, as you only would think if you&#x2019;re a total fool (or, perhaps, if you were about to lose your career and your husband and your home in one uncompromising swoop): The world, my world, is good.<br> <br>I stayed in bed, in my fresh Frette sheets (a birthday present to myself), the sunlight drifting through the windows, the air chilly and light. And I listened to the entire song, crooning assuredly through my apartment.<br> <br>Are you familiar with the song &#x201c;Moonlight Mile&#x201d;? It&#x2019;s a Rolling Stones song&#x2014;not nearly as popular as their ubiquitous &#x201c;You Can&#x2019;t Always Get What You Want&#x201d; or as wedding-song-sticky as &#x201c;Wild Horses.&#x201d; &#x201c;Moonlight Mile&#x201d; is just the most honest rock song ever recorded. I don&#x2019;t offer that as my personal opinion. I share that as fact: an inarguable fact, which you should twist into your brain and heart so that when someone argues the virtues of a different song as the epitome of greatness (prepare for the Beatles, who naturally arise as a challenge to the Stones), you can smile and quietly think, I know better. It&#x2019;s nice to know better. It&#x2019;s nice to know that when you hear the closing guitar riff of &#x201c;Moonlight Mile,&#x201d; what you&#x2019;re actually hearing is a piece of music so soft and difficult, so dangerous and quiet, so full of life and death and love, that just below its surface, the song is telling you a secret&#x2014;a secret that I was just starting to understand&#x2014;about everything that matters in this world, everything that grounds us and eventually leaves us, all at once.<br> <br>The tricky part is that the song was the product of an all night jam session between Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor. It was Taylor who had taken a short guitar piece recorded by Keith Richards and reworked it for the session. And it was Taylor&#x2019;s idea to add a string arrangement to the final song. The legend goes that Taylor, for good reason, was promised a songwriting credit. But &#x201c;Moonlight Mile&#x201d; was officially credited to Jagger/Richards. Keith Richards would later deny Taylor&#x2019;s involvement at all, and say that Mick Jagger delivered the song to the band all on his own.<br> <br>Normally, if you were to ask me about this, I&#x2019;d say: Who cares? The credit didn&#x2019;t matter, what mattered was the song. Taylor kept playing with the band, so he&#x2019;d let it go.<br> <br>Except on the morning in question&#x2014;the morning of my thirty-fifth birthday, the morning of my crisp Frette sheets, of rightness in the world&#x2014;the injustice of Mick Taylor&#x2019;s omission was at the forefront of my mind, and I looked him up on my phone.<br> <br>Considering what was about to happen to my world, it was odd that this was the moment I focused on Taylor. Call it foreshadowing, call it intuition. For the first time, I found myself sympathizing with him. Even though, in my particular story, I&#x2019;m not the guy you root for. I&#x2019;m not Mick Taylor. I&#x2019;m not even Mick Jagger.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m Keith Richards, getting credit and telling lies from outside the room.<br> <br>I heard a groan next to me. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you make a rule about phones in bed?&#x201d;<br> <br>I turned to see my husband, waking up, yawning for effect. Danny Walker: Iowa raised, strong chin, fearless. His eyes were still closed, his long eyelashes (thick lashes, like someone had tinted them, slathered them with rich mascara) clasped tightly together.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t even see my phone,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to, I can feel it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>He opened his eyes, stunning green eyes, those lashes surrounding them like a web. I resented those lashes, those eyes. Danny was more naturally beautiful than any woman would ever figure out how to be. Especially his wife. And while some women might have been okay with that, proud even, or so blissfully in love they didn&#x2019;t keep score, I was not one of those women. I kept score. I hadn&#x2019;t always, but somewhere along the way I started to. Which maybe was part of the problem. But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your rule,&#x201d; he said, pointing at the phone. &#x201c;Shut it off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the first thing you want to say to me today?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Happy birthday.&#x201d; He smiled, his great smile. &#x201c;Shut it off.&#x201d;<br> <br>He moved his hand down my stomach, his touch ice cold. Our apartment was an old converted loft in Tribeca (recently photographed for Architectural Digest), a few blocks off the Hudson River, and freezing in the morning. No matter the season, no matter June&#x2019;s gnarly heat. It was freezing. It was also oddly loud, the noises from the highway and the river comingling to remind you there was nowhere else in the world in quite the same identity crisis. It was by far the nicest place we&#x2019;d lived together&#x2014;a large step up from the first place we&#x2019;d shared at the University of Oregon. A garden apartment, the landlord had called it. He was right in that you could see the garden from the basement windows that looked up toward it.<br> <br>There were three apartments after that, but none of them had the loft&#x2019;s corner windows&#x2014;with views of the Hudson River and Battery Park&#x2014;making everything in New York look beautiful.<br> <br>I tossed my phone to the side of the bed, tossed Mick Taylor to the side.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. Let&#x2019;s start again, then. Happy birthday, baby,&#x201d; he said. And, for a second, I wondered if he&#x2019;d been thinking the same thing about our real estate past, our shared history.<br> <br>He started to kiss me, and I stopped thinking. All these years in, I could still get lost in it. Lost in Danny. How many people, fourteen years in, could say that? And, yes, I&#x2019;m glossing over the other part&#x2014;the part where that took a hit. But I had vowed to change all that. And, at this particular moment, I was dedicated to changing all that. Very dedicated.<br> <br>Danny moved on top of me, his hands working their way down my thighs, when I heard it. My phone beeped from the side of the bed, a bright and shiny email notification coming across its screen.<br> <br>I flinched, instinctively wanting to grab it. It could have been important. A hundred and fifty people worked on my show; it usually was.<br> <br>Danny peered at the phone out of the corner of his eye. &#x201c;How is that putting your phone away?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be really quick,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>He forced a smile, moving away. &#x201c;No, you won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I flipped to my inbox screen, and there was the email.<br> <br>The subject line was simple enough.<br> <br>Hello, Sunshine<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t recognize the sender&#x2019;s email address. So I almost didn&#x2019;t open it. I like to tell myself that if I hadn&#x2019;t, I could have stopped everything that came next.<br> <br>Door one: Sunshine Mackenzie ignores the email, has birthday sex with her husband, and life goes on as usual. Door two: Sunshine pushes her husband aside and opens an email from someone called Aintnosunshine, and life as she knows it ends.<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s guess which door I took.<br> <br>Do you know who this is? Here&#x2019;s a hint: I&#x2019;m about to ruin you.<br> <br>I laughed, a little loudly. After all, it was such a ridiculous email. So incredibly over-the-top, like the spam you get from Nigeria asking you to send your bank account information.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d; Danny said.<br> <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;Nothing. Just a silly email.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They usually are.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was a point of friction between us. Whereas my entire career existed online, Danny was an architect and sometimes didn&#x2019;t even check his email more than a couple times a day. He&#x2019;d learned how to contain it, disregarding ridiculous emails from difficult clients, who were obsessed with their Gramercy Park brownstones, their Bowery rooftops. He&#x2019;d learned how to contain it, so he could get the work done for them. It was a skill that his wife, apparently, had yet to learn.<br> <br>I turned back to my phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right. You&#x2019;ve chosen,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Then he pulled the blankets back, got out of bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I said. And I reached to pull him back down. &#x201c;Danny! Please come back. That&#x2019;s a birthday order.&#x201d;<br> <br>He laughed. &#x201c;Nope, too late.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then the next email came in.<br> <br>Do you think I was kidding? I&#x2019;m not the kidding type.<br> <br>Some would even say humorless: www.twitter.com/sunshinecooks<br> <br>This stopped me cold. Why did he choose the word humorless? (At that moment in time, knowing nothing, I thought the hacker was a he.) It was a specific word. It was also a word I used often.<br> <br>So I clicked on the link.<br> <br>And there was my verified Twitter account staring back at me.<br> <br>There was my profile complete with a photograph of me in my studio kitchen&#x2014;wearing a peasant blouse and strategically distressed jeans, my blond hair swept off my face in a loose bun.<br> <br>@SunshineCooks<br> <br>Cooking for a New Generation.

I quickly pulled the phone away. Even in the chaos, I still had an instinct to control it, keep it close. And, of course, to keep it away from him.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what? It&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sunny . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Danny, I&#x2019;m forwarding it to Ryan now. He&#x2019;ll deal with it. It&#x2019;s his job.&#x201d;<br> <br>Danny looked unconvinced. Fourteen years. He knew things. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;<br> <br>I forced a smile and repeated that all was well. So he nodded, walked away.<br> <br>First, though, he leaned down to kiss me. A sweet kiss. A birthday kiss. Not the sex that we&#x2019;d been close to, but something. Something lovely.<br> <br>Which was when the phone&#x2019;s bright light shined again, another tweet coming in.<br> <br>Let me stop there, though.<br> <br>Before we got the next tweet, the next hack, before we got to what it said. The thing that led to the demise of my career, my home, my marriage.<br> <br>You remember how I told you that there were two things you should know right up front?<br> <br>The first was how it happened. On the morning of my thirty-fifth birthday, &#x201c;Moonlight Mile&#x201d; welcomed me to my day, my husband still loved me, and then the email came in. The start of something I couldn&#x2019;t stop.<br> <br>The second thing you should know? I was not (certainly at that moment in time) a good person. Some would even say I was a bad person.

Naturally, this is an essential question for those approaching this important life transition. Essentially, if you wish to retire one day, you are increasingly responsible for figuring out how to save during your working years and convert your savings into sustainable income for an ever-lengthening number of retirement years. The nature of risk also changes in retirement, as the lifestyle of retirees become more vulnerable to the impacts of market volatility, unknown longevity, and spending shocks. Retirees have one opportunity to build a successful plan. It is not an easy task, but it is manageable.<br><br> This book focuses on sustainable spending from investments, which is an important piece of any retirement plan. People want to know if they have saved enough to be able to fund their lifestyle in retirement. In this book, I explain the findings of a large body of financial planning research regarding sustainable spending from investment portfolios in the face of a variety of retirement risks.<br><br> That body of research tends to begin with the 4 percent rule of thumb for retirement spending. I explain how and why it was developed, what it means, and when it may or may not be appropriate for retirees. William Bengen&#x2019;s 1994 study gave us the concept of the SAFEMAX, which is the highest sustainable spending rate from the worst-case scenario observed in the US historical data. The Trinity study added portfolio success rates from the historical data for different spending strategies. Both studies suggest that for a thirty-year retirement period, a 4 percent inflation-adjusted withdrawal rate using a 50&#x2013;75 percent stock allocation should be reasonably safe.<br><br> I have reservations about the 4 percent rule. It may be too aggressive for current retirees for reasons including increasing longevity, historically low interest rates coupled with higher than average stock market valuations, the impact of the international experience with the 4 percent rule casting a different light than 20th century US historical data, the need to maintain a rather aggressive asset allocation to have the best shot at success, and because the 4 percent rule assumes that investors do not pay any fees or otherwise underperform the underlying market indices.<br><br> However, other factors suggest that sustainable spending may be even higher than traditional studies imply. Reasons for this include that actual retirees may tend to reduce their spending with age, that they build more diversified portfolios than used in the basic research studies, that real-world retirees may be willing to adjust spending for realized portfolio performance, and that some retirees may have the capacity and tolerance to accept higher portfolio failure probabilities because they have other sources of income from outside their portfolios. Related to these points, I also analyze nine variable spending strategies for retirees as well as the use of strategies that support short-term spending needs with individual bonds and longer-term spending needs with stocks.<br><br> Retirees need to weigh the consequences between spending too little and spending too much&#x2014;that is, being too frugal or running out of assets. This book is about implementing what I call the &#x201c;probability-based&#x201d; school of thought for retirement planning. It is especially relevant for people who plan to fund their retirements using an investment portfolio and those who are hesitant about using income annuities or other insurance products. I will explore annuities and insurance more extensively in later volumes since I do believe in the value of risk pooling as an additional source of returns to more efficiently meet retirement spending goals. But for now, we have plenty to discuss within the world of sustainable spending from an investment portfolio in retirement. The book concludes with a discussion about how to put these ideas together into a retirement spending plan.</p><p>Wade D.

Withfrequent references to Monte Carlo simulations and the work of financial adviser William Bengen, Pfau leads readersthrough spending and investment tactics, presenting the many possible outcomes based on known probabilities andassumptions about the economy of the coming decades. The volume delves into the relationship between spending andreturns, demonstrating how each can be adjusted to compensate for changes in the other and for the retiree's personalgoals and risk tolerance. With graphs illustrating every arrangement discussed, the book makes it clear that readers whoplan to take an active role in managing their retirement funds must have the patience to study all possible scenarios inorder to approach investing knowledgeably. The author is candid about the shortcomings of historical data as a basis forinvestment decisions because of the unusually low interest rates of the present day and the fact that the information isdrawn from a limited number of overlapping periods that disproportionately emphasize the mid-20th century. While thework is focused primarily on the underlying theory, it does spend some time on concrete investment advice, highlightingthe advantages of delaying Social Security payouts and explaining how to build a bond portfolio. The volume will likelybe of greatest relevance to readers who are comfortable with statistical analysis and have the financial expertise toimplement the high-level recommendations in the context of their own economic situations; audiences in search of moredirect tips on retirement planning should look elsewhere. But for those with the necessary background knowledge, Pfauoffers a clear and coherent text ("The argument is that when retirees instead have a front-end bond ladder, they knowthere is time for stocks to recover before they need to be sold"), which should help those intending to actively managetheir retirement funds.<br><br>A detailed and well-written guide to retirement planning for those with financial literacy.&nbsp;<br><br><b>- Kirkus Reviews</b></p><h2>Without Rival: Embrace Your Identity and Purpose in an Age of Confusion and Comparison</h2><p><b>Now a </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestseller!<br></b><br>There is a reason we look at others as rivals and limit ourselves to comparison and competition.

I always knew I had good parents, but it wasn&#39;t until our first child was born that it dawned on me: I had some of the best. I quickly realized that if I could be half the father my dad was I would be a raging success, but that was no easy task! Within days of Jude&#39;s birth I found myself regularly calling mom or dad and asking a barrage of questions. Now as we enter the teenage years I have more questions than ever before. My parents don&#39;t have all the answers, but they have more than a little wisdom to pass on to a generation that is reeling from the dissolution of the family in Western culture, and the corresponding emotional, relational, and spiritual fallout. Our family has its fair share of dysfunction, as all families do, but to this day our entire family is following Jesus, and for my parents, that was always the number one goal. If you share that goal, I can&#39;t think of a better guide for the journey than this book.

Too often, however, the problem is not that we don't know what God desires for our lives, but rather that we just don't want to do what we already know he wants. How might our wills be changed so that we become both willing and able to do what God asks of us? In <em>Desiring God's Will</em> psychologist and spiritual director David G. Benner explores the transformation of the will in Christian spirituality. He examines why our desires are disordered and how our human volition can be brought into alignment with God's intentions so that we willingly choose that which God wants for us. In so doing, Benner shows us that cultivating discernment and being attuned to God's desires is the path to true life, spiritual health and freedom. God wants to change our choosing, not just our choices. By aligning our hearts with God's, we will find liberation from the kingdom of self and instead experience the joy of the kingdom of God. This expanded edition, one of three titles in The Spiritual Journey trilogy, includes a new epilogue and an experiential guide with questions for individual reflection or group discussion.</p><p>Features &amp; Benefits <p>* Explores how we can be willing and able to do what God asks of us</p><p>* Shows how to align our hearts and desires with God</p><p>* Promises liberation from the "kingdom of self"</p><p>* Opens up a path to spiritual health, joyful life and true freedom</p><p>* Written by a psychologist and spiritual director</p><p>* Draws on classic Christian spiritual writers</p><p>* Includes exercises and questions for personal reflection</p>"This is for people who want God. Even more, it is for people who want to want God. It is about not the taming of the will but its transformation." John Ortberg, author, teaching pastor, Menlo Park Presbyterian Church <p>"David Benner never disappoints. He is intelligent without being academic, psychologically astute without being trendy, spiritually profound without being pious. He clearly knows the landscape from which he dares to speak." Fr. Richard Rohr, O.F.M., Center for Action and Contemplation, Albuquerque, New Mexico </p><p>"In Desiring God's Will, the third in his trilogy, David Benner writes in a deeply personal way of the corrective activist Christians need, not so much to seek guidance as to deeply desire God's will. No more important message could be given us in our narcissistic culture. Poignantly written, this is a life-changing book." James M. Houston, Emeritus Professor of Regent College, Regent College, Vancouver </p><p> "This is really a wonderful book, a powerful book, a life-giving book--Benner speaks so honestly, openly and directly to our lust for the self-determination and control that keeps us from knowing the joy and freedom of a God-centered life, a life of willingness in response to God's constant personal love. Reading this book I came to know more fully than ever before how much God desires me." Dom M. Basil Pennington, O.C.S.O., author of Lectio Divina and Centering Prayer </p><p>"Benner has provided a masterful understanding of God's will that rightly places the emphasis upon a loving, responsive relationship with God rather than the correct performance of a structure of 'duties.' This is one of very few books on Christian spirituality that I couldn't wait to get back to when I had to break off reluctantly for other duties." M. Robert Mulholland, author of Invitation to a Journey </p><p>"David Benner has a unique perspective in assisting the contemporary pray-er to achieve that true openness which is essential for genuine discernment. . . . Desiring God's Will achieves a happy balance of tradition and contemporary relevance."

In these poems and pictures drawn by the young inmates of Terezin, we see the daily misery of these uprooted children, as well as their courage and optimism, their hopes and fears. The ghetto of Terezin (Theresienstadt), located in the hills outside Prague, was an unusual concentration camp in that it was created to cover up the Nazi genocide of the Jews. Billed as the &#34;Fuhrer&#39;s gift to the Jews&#34;, this &#34;model ghetto&#34; was the site of a Red Cross inspection visit in 1944. With its high proportion of artists and intellectuals, culture flourished in the ghetto - alongside starvation, disease, and constant dread of transports to the death camps of the east. Every one of its inhabitants was condemned in advance to die. These innocent and honest depictions allow us to see through the eyes of the children what life was like in the ghetto. The children&#39;s poems and drawings, revealing maturity beyond their years, are haunting reminders of what no child should ever have to see. This expanded edition of I Never Saw Another Butterfly is published in cooperation with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.Edited by <b>HANA VOLVAKOV�</b> (1904-1985), who was the only curator of the Central Jewish Museum to survive World War II. The authors/artists of the poems, letters, and drawings in <i>I Never Saw Another Butterfly</i> were the children of Terezin Concentration Camp.

That's literally it. Among other gems, you can expect some cats flaunting some fabulous wigs, sloths dangling casually, otters holding hands (an actual thing that occurs in nature) and piglets wearing little rain boots for some adorable reason. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this book is a landmark moment in the history of photojournalism. <br><br>While turning these puppy-peppered pages, your mood will literally become one of delight and tenderness. And therein lies the powerful magic of pictures of cute animals. Just simply peering into those big eyes carries with it all the gravitas of a David Attenborough nature documentary, but without having to actually watch a documentary. <br><br>The resilience of the animal kingdom is endlessly inspiring. Cast your mind to this iconic image: a kitten dangling from a tree branch, while sagely encouraging us humans to just "hang in there." And hang in there we did--in order to own this book. This is literally exactly what our turbulent world needs right now. With its unique meow factor, this is the book that you deserve after a ruff day at work.

Now readers can explore these ruins in this compelling Where Is? title.</b><br><br>Built in the fifteenth century and tucked away in the mountains of Peru, Machu Picchu was abandoned after the Spaniards conquered the Incan empire in the sixteenth century. It remained hidden until 1911 when Hiram Bingham uncovered the marvelous complex and shared his discovery with the world. Today, hundreds of thousands of people visit the site to climb the 3,000 stone steps, explore the towering monuments, and see the numerous species that call these famous ruins home.</p><p>Megan Stine has written several books for young readers, including <i>Where Is the White House?</i>, <i>Who Was Marie Curie?</i>, <i>Who Was Ulysses S. Grant?</i>, <i>Who Is Michelle Obama?</i>, and <i>Who Was Sally Ride?</i> She lives in Clinton, Connecticut.<b>Where Is Machu Picchu?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Flocks of green parrots flew overhead in the jungle. The air was sticky and damp. It was July 24, 1911. Hiram Bingham and six other explorers had been trekking through the jungles of South America for days. The thirty-five-year-old professor from Yale University was on a quest. He was searching for the place where an ancient people called the Incas had once lived and then died out four hundred years before.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since childhood, Hiram had dreamed of a life of adventure. Now he was finally living it. He was leading an expedition that included a doctor, a naturalist, and a geographer. They were in Peru, where Hiram hoped to discover the ruins of the lost Inca city of Vilcabamba. He wanted to become famous.<br> &nbsp;<br> The beauty of the jungle was breathtaking. Orchids bloomed everywhere. Snowcapped mountains towered above. Hiram and his fellow explorers followed a path along a river. They passed waterfalls and tree-size ferns.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hiram later wrote, &#x201c;I know of no place in the world which can compare with it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But after five days, some in the group were tired. They didn&#x2019;t want to keep going. The journey had been hard. They were riding mules through a jungle that was overgrown with vines and buzzing with insects. Poisonous snakes slithered about. They decided to stay behind at the camp to wash their clothes or hunt for butterflies.<br> &nbsp;<br> So on the sixth morning of the trek, Hiram set out with just one other companion&#x2014;a sergeant from the Peruvian government. They were led by a local guide named Melchor Arteaga. Melchor had said that if they crossed the river and climbed two thousand feet up the mountain, they would find some ruins&#x2014;ancient buildings that had fallen apart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Could this be the magnificent city Hiram Bingham was looking for?<br> &nbsp;<br> Hiram sort of doubted it. He had a rule for himself: Whenever someone told him fabulous stories of lost treasure, Hiram reminded himself that it might be just a story.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, he was curious. He was also determined and energetic. So he followed Melchor across a shaky bridge over rushing water. The bridge was made of only a few logs tied with vines. Melchor and the sergeant walked across the wobbly bridge, but Hiram felt safer crawling on his hands and knees. Then he followed the guide up a steep trail for more than an hour, part of the way on all fours.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time they reached the ridge of the mountain, Hiram and the sergeant were exhausted. And all they saw were some huts and stone walls. A few local people seemed to be living there. They offered Hiram water and cooked sweet potatoes.<br> &nbsp;<br> The view from this spot was magnificent. Hiram could see down to the river valley far below. He could also see up to the snowy mountains high overhead. It was like living in the clouds.<br> &nbsp;<br> But had he come all this way for nothing more than an incredible view of nature?<br> &nbsp;<br> No. As soon as he walked a little farther and rounded a corner, he came upon something incredible. There was an entire city of ruins.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hiram had not found Vilcabamba. Instead, he had found something much better&#x2014;the hidden city of Machu Picchu (say: MAT-choo PEE-choo). It was an Inca city that no one in the outside world even knew existed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Who Were the Incas?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Many hundreds of years ago, long before the time of European explorers, native peoples lived in tribes in both North and South America. They hunted, fished, grew crops, and sometimes fought. Their lives were simple.<br> &nbsp;<br> But in the 1400s, in one area of South America, a tribe called the Incas did much more than that. The king ruled over a vast empire. Its capital was a city called Cuzco. There were roads and stone houses. The Incas created wonderful art. They learned how to work with metals like copper and bronze, and to make gold and silver jewelry. They wove special fabrics with fancy designs for the royalty. They studied the sky to learn about the sun, moon, and stars.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although they didn&#x2019;t have written language, the Incas kept records of everything. They used a system of knots tied on strings. These were called quipus (say: KEE-poos). With the quipus, they could keep track of how much land they owned. They also kept count of how many people lived in the Inca world.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Incas believed that they were a special people, chosen by their gods. They worshipped the sun, and built stone temples for religious ceremonies. The temple in Cuzco was an incredible building, decorated with real gold. It was made out of stones cut so perfectly that they fitted tightly together, without cement or mortar.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside the temple was a golden statue of the sun god, named Inti. He was shown as a boy, with snakes and lions coming out of his body. Outside, there were life-size animal statues made of gold&#x2014;monkeys, llamas, guinea pigs, jaguars, birds, and butterflies. All gold!<br> &nbsp;<br> There was even a garden filled with life-size golden corn plants.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were also niches inside the temples. Niches are indented spaces in a wall that usually hold a statue. But the Incas didn&#x2019;t put statues in niches. On special occasions, they put mummies in them instead!<br> &nbsp;<br> Whenever an Inca king died, his body was mummified. It was treated in a way that would stop it from rotting. The mummy was cared for as if it were still alive. People offered food to the mummy. They presented gifts to the mummy and dressed it in the best clothing, with gold and feathers. The mummy could then be carried around, from place to place, wherever the new king went. Servants were always nearby to keep flies away from the mummy. During ceremonies and rituals, the mummies were placed in the temple niches, a place of honor.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Incas hadn&#x2019;t always been a strong nation. In the early 1400s, the tribe was small and weak. But their city of Cuzco had great weather and good soil for growing crops. It made living there easy. A rival tribe called the Chancas wanted to live there, too. So the Chancas began marching toward Cuzco, planning to attack.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Inca king was old and afraid. He ran away and hid. But his son was smart and strong. He quickly made friends with other small tribes and put together an army. They marched out to fight the Chancas before the Chancas could attack them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Incas fought a bloody battle with spiked wooden clubs. They won by capturing the mummy of the Chanca king. The Chancas thought they had no power without their mummy king. So they gave up. Then the Inca king&#x2019;s son became the new king.<br> &nbsp;<br> The young king chose a new name for himself&#x2014;Pachacuti (say: patch-a-KOO-tee). It meant &#x201c;earth-shaker&#x201d; or &#x201c;someone who turns the world upside down.&#x201d; The new king had just done that&#x2014;he had turned the world upside down by defeating the Chancas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pretty soon, he would shake&#x2014;and shape&#x2014;the Inca world even more.</p><h2>National Geographic Rarely Seen: Photographs of the Extraordinary (National Geographic Collectors Series)</h2><p>National Geographic's dazzling photography book of visual wonders, shot by some of the world's finest photographers, reveals a world very few will have the chance to see for themselves.

Neil Pasricha is a Harvard MBA, a <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author, a Walmart executive, a father, a husband. After selling more than a million copies of the<i> Book of Awesome</i> series, wherein he observed the everyday things he thought were awesome, he now shifts his focus to the practicalities of living an awesome life.<br><br>In his new book <i>The Happiness Equation</i>, Pasricha illustrates how to want nothing and do anything in order to have everything. If that sounds like a contradiction in terms, you simply have yet to unlock the 9 Secrets to Happiness. Each secret takes a piece out of the core of common sense, turns it on its head to present it in a completely new light, and then provides practical and specific guidelines for how to apply this new outlook to lead a fulfilling life.<br><br>Once you've unlocked Pasricha&#x2019;s 9 Secrets, you will understand counter intuitive concepts such as: Success Does Not Lead to Happiness, Never Take Advice, and Retirement Is a Broken Theory. You will learn and then master three brand-new fundamental life tests: the Saturday Morning Test, The Bench Test, and the Five People Test. You will know the difference between external goals and internal goals and how to make more money than a Harvard MBA (hint: it has nothing to do with your annual salary). You will discover that true wealth has nothing to do with money, multitasking is a myth, and the elimination of options leads to more choice.<br><i><br>The Happiness Equation </i>is a book that will change how you think about pretty much everything&#x2014;your time, your career, your relationships, your family, and, ultimately, of course, your happiness.</p><p><b>Neil Pasricha</b> is the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of <i>The Happiness Equation</i> and the <i>Book of Awesome</i> series, which has been published in ten countries, spent more than five years on bestsellers lists, and sold more than a million copies.

That model is broken. We do great work, have a big success, but instead of being happy, we just set new goals. Now we study for the next job, the next degree, the next promotion. Why stop at a college degree when you can get a master&#x2019;s? Why stop at Director when you can be VP? Why stop at one house when you can have two? We never get to happiness. It keeps getting pushed further and further away.<br> What happens when we snap &#x201c;Be happy&#x201d; off the end of this&nbsp;scribble and stick it on the beginning? <br>&nbsp;<br> Now everything changes. <i>Everything </i>changes. If we start with being happy, then we feel great. We look great. We exercise. We con- nect. What happens? We end up doing great work because we <i>feel </i>great doing it. What does great work lead to? Big success. Massive feelings of accomplishment and the resulting degrees, promotions, and phone calls from your mom telling you she&#x2019;s proud of you.<br><br> <i>Harvard Business Review </i>reports that happy people are 31% more productive, have 37% higher sales, and are three times more creative than their counterparts.<br><br> So what&#x2019;s the <i>first </i>thing you must do before you can be happy? Be happy.&nbsp;Be happy <i>first</i>.<br><br> Being happy opens up your learning centers. Your brain will light up like Manhattan skyscrapers at dusk, sparkle like diamonds under jewelry store lights, glow like stars in the black sky above a farmer&#x2019;s field.<br><br> American philosopher William James &nbsp;says, &#x201c;The greatest dis- covery of any generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>The Happiness Advantage &nbsp;</i>author Shawn Achor says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s &nbsp;not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.&#x201d;<br><br> William Shakespeare &nbsp;says, &#x201c;For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;<br><b>2. The single biggest reason it&#x2019;s so hard &nbsp;to be happy</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>Shakespeare &nbsp;says, &#x201c;For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.&#x201d; But if it&#x2019;s just thinking, plain thinking,&nbsp;why can&#x2019;t we&nbsp;<i>think </i>ourselves into a good mood whenever we want? <br><br>Seems like we should be able to just flip a mental switch.<br><br> But we all know it&#x2019;s not that easy. Sometimes our brains get fo- cused on negative things. We can&#x2019;t stop! I do this all the time. And you want to know a secret? Everybody &nbsp;does. Every single person gets stuck focusing on the negative sometimes. I&#x2019;ve spoken on stages with the best-known motivational speakers, Fortune 500 CEOs, and political leaders from around the world. Do you know what they&#x2019;re all doing backstage? Freaking out. Sweating. Thinking something might go wrong.<br><br> We all have negative self-talk. There is no such thing as an eter- nal optimist. There are people who feel optimistic, but those people have negative self-talk, too. And that&#x2019;s okay. The problem isn&#x2019;t that we have negative thoughts in our brain.<br><br> The problem is we think we shouldn&#x2019;t have negative thoughts.<br><br> But <i>why </i>do our brains focus on negative things? Once we under- stand this we can learn how much we can control and make con- scious efforts to be happy using proven techniques.<br><br>This is one of the most important things I can share with you. Why is it so hard to be happy? <br><br>Because life was mostly short, brutal, and &nbsp;highly &nbsp;competitive over &nbsp;the two hundred thousand years our species has existed on this planet. And our brains are trained for this short, brutal, and highly competitive world.<br> &nbsp;<br> How short, brutal, and highly competitive was it?&nbsp;Let&#x2019;s do a quick experiment.<br><br> Stop, close your eyes, and picture the last time you felt com- pletely alone in the middle of nowhere.<br><br> Was it camping in the mountains when you walked away from the fire and stood on the jagged edge of a mirrory lake? Was it a misty waterfall you found on a field trip when your classmates dis- appeared and all you could hear was the wind rustling the leaves in the forest canopy? Was it jogging at sunrise on a sandy beach when you curled around the coastline and suddenly couldn&#x2019;t see anyone for miles in any direction?<br><br> Picture yourself back in that scene.<br><br> Now mentally erase from our planet all of the following: <br>� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toilets<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinks<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Showers<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Running water<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computers<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phones<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beds<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chairs<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roads<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bikes<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cars<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planes<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boats<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Books<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paper<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pencils<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pens<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctors<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medicines<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grocery stores<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fridges<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freezers<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farms<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stoves<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microwaves<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirts<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweaters<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackets<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pants<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Socks<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoes<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underwear <br><br> You are now standing alone in the middle of the planet with none of those things. Take your phone out of your pocket and toss it away. Take your shoes &nbsp;and shirt off, too, because &nbsp;they don&#x2019;t exist. Take everything off. You are completely naked with noth- ing around. None of those things exist. And none of them will be gin to exist before the end of your life!<br><br> Now close your eyes, picture yourself there, and remember that:<br> &nbsp;<br> 99% of our history was living in this world.<br> 99% of our history was with a life span of thirty years.<br> 99% of our history was with brains constantly battling for survival.<br> &nbsp;<br> Life was short, brutal, and highly competitive, and we have the same brains now that we&#x2019;ve had throughout our history.<br><br> Were we happy back then? The better question &nbsp;is: Did we have time to be happy?<br><br>This instinctive need for what we don&#x2019;t yet have creates in us a persistent state of dissatisfaction. Without it, our ancestors would always be only one failed hunting session away from starvation. This simple, ruthless script is pro- grammed to drive survival at all costs. It works exceed- ingly well for this purpose, but it leaves us feeling stress and unpleasantness much of the time. Unhappiness is na- ture&#x2019;s way of keeping people on their toes. It&#x2019;s a crude sys- tem, but it has worked for thousands of years. <br>&nbsp;<br> We have the same brains we&#x2019;ve always had through this short, bru- tal, and highly competitive time in our history. Our brains didn&#x2019;t just suddenly change when we got printing presses, airplanes, and the Internet. How have our brains been programmed? <br><br> What did this fear do? It drove our survival. We survived at all costs. We were paranoid. We were fighters. We were ruthless. We were brutal. We were murderous. And because of it . . . we got here. And because of it . . . we took over the planet. And because of it . . . we have everything in the world.<br><br> So this begs the question: Is that fear still programmed into our heads today?<br><b>3. The one thing &nbsp;your doctor, &nbsp;teacher, and&nbsp;Tom Hanks &nbsp;all have &nbsp;in common</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>Yes, that fear is still programmed into our heads.<br><br> It&#x2019;s everywhere, it&#x2019;s between our ears, it&#x2019;s in our brains. Tom Hanks, one of the world&#x2019;s most successful actors, who earns&nbsp;millions with every movie and has scored two Academy Awards, said, &#x201c;Some people go to bed at night thinking, &#x2018;That was a good day.&#x2019; I am one of those who worries and asks, &#x2018;How did I screw up today?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br> Andy Grove is the longtime Intel executive who helped trans- form the company into a multibillion-dollar &nbsp;success. He was be- lieved by many to have helped drive the growth phase of Silicon Valley, was named <i>Time</i>&#x2019;s Man of the Year in 1997, and was idolized by Steve Jobs, according to Jobs&#x2019;s biography. How did he famously put it? &#x201c;Only the paranoid survive.&#x201d;<br><br> Our brains still follow this paranoid model every day, and it is a recipe for unhappiness! Some call it Medical Student&#x2019;s Syndrome. That&#x2019;s &nbsp;a term Jerome K. Jerome first coined in his 1889 classic, <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>: &#x201c;I remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a touch&#x2014;hay fever, I fancy it was. I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally. I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into&#x2014;some fearful, devastating scourge, I know&#x2014;and, before I had glanced half down the list of &#x2018;premonitory symptoms,&#x2019; it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.<br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;I sat for a while, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of despair, I again turned over the pages. I came to typhoid fever&#x2014; read the symptoms&#x2014;discovered &nbsp;that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for months without knowing it&#x2014;wondered what else I had got; turned up St. Vitus&#x2019;s Dance&#x2014;found, as I expected, that I had that, too&#x2014;began to get interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so started alphabetically&#x2014;read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight . . .&#x201d;<br> It&#x2019;s not just medical students. We&#x2019;ve all been there.<br><br> We scan the world for problems because that led to our survival. And our current design of the world only reinforces and grows these negative-lens feelings.<br><br> At your doctor&#x2019;s office when you get lab results, the doctor says, &#x201c;Your blood sugar is fine, your cholesterol is fine, but your iron is low.&#x201d; What do you do? You talk about getting your iron up. Eat steak! No work is done improving your blood sugar or cholesterol. If cholesterol should be below 200mg/dL &nbsp;and you&#x2019;re &nbsp;at 195, great! If you&#x2019;re 205, that&#x2019;s a problem. Doctors get paid when we&#x2019;re sick. Shouldn&#x2019;t we pay them when we&#x2019;re healthy?<br><br> Retail store managers &nbsp;&#x201c;manage by exception&#x201d; by staring at morning reports, finding a number below average, and trying to bump it up. If that report says your traffic count is fine, basket size is fine, but checkout time is below average, what does the boss want? Faster checkouts. More cashiers! No work is done improving statis- tics that are already average.<br><br> In the classroom the teacher hands back test results and offers extra help to those below average. They have to pass! If not, the&nbsp;year is repeated, the system &nbsp;is drained, friends all move ahead. What happens for the below average kids? Extra help at lunch. Tutoring sessions. Remedial tests. Why aren&#x2019;t students who get 100% offered any extra challenge?<br>&nbsp; <br>It&#x2019;s no different in the workplace. We get job evaluations show- ing how well we&#x2019;re doing. What happens if you&#x2019;re below expecta- tions? &nbsp;Performance improvement plan! &nbsp;Extra meetings with the boss! Shipped to training classes! What happens if you&#x2019;re &nbsp;doing well? Two percent raise. Pat on the back.<br><br> Rather than find good results and make them better, our brains do this:<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. &nbsp;Look for problem.<br> 2. &nbsp;Find problem.<br> 3. &nbsp;Improve problem.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s &nbsp;what our brains have been trained to do for two hun- dred thousand years. But because we scan the world for problems, sometimes that&#x2019;s all we see. Here&#x2019;s how <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author Kelly Oxford framed our Medical Student&#x2019;s Syndrome on Twitter: &#x201c;WebMD is &nbsp;like a Choose Your Own Adventure book where the ending is always cancer.&#x201d;<br> So what do we do about it? <br><br>&nbsp;<br><b>5. How much &nbsp;can we control?</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>Aristotle says, &#x201c;Happiness depends upon ourselves.&#x201d;<br><br> Viktor Frankl says, &#x201c;Everything &nbsp;can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms&#x2014;to &nbsp;choose one&#x2019;s at- titude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&#x2019;s own way.&#x201d; Walt Whitman &nbsp;writes, &nbsp;&#x201c;Keep your face always toward the&nbsp;sunshine&#x2014;and shadows will fall behind you.&#x201d;<br><br> I love what Artistotle, Viktor Frankl, and Walt Whitman say. But how do you get there?<br> Well, we now have scientific evidence of the importance of atti- tude and specific proven actions we can take to manage our attitude.<br>&nbsp; <br>Do you know what&#x2019;s amazing about this quote? The second last sentence!<br><br> &#x201c;I am convinced that life is 10% what happens and 90% how I&nbsp;react to it.&#x201d;<br><br> Well, new research published in <i>The How of Happiness </i>by Uni- versity of California psychology professor Sonja Lyubomirsky tells us exactly how much of our happiness is based on our life circumstances.<br><br> And it is 10%!<br><br> 10% of our happiness is what happens <i>to </i>us.<br> &nbsp;<br>So 90% of our happiness isn&#x2019;t based on what&#x2019;s happening in the world! <i>It&#x2019;s based on how we see the world</i>. What&#x2019;s included in the&nbsp;90%? Our genetic predisposition and our intentional activities. Yes, intentional activities. This is big. Those are <i>specific things </i>we can do to improve our happiness. And they alone have <i>four times the ef- fect on our happiness </i>than anything happening in our life. <br><br> Let me put it another way:&nbsp;If I knew everything about your life circumstances&#x2014;your job, your health, your marital status, your income&#x2014;I could predict only&nbsp;10% of your happiness.

But instead, he finds himself at the center of a ruthless conspiracy to overthrow the emperor and spark the Praetor War, a battle to destroy Rome from within. Traitors and spies lurk at every turn, each more desperate than the next to use Nic's newfound powers for their own dark purposes.<br>In a quest to stop the rebellion, save Rome, and secure his own freedom, Nic must harness the magic within himself and defeat the empire's most powerful and savage leaders.</p><p>Jennifer A.

Jennifer lives in northern Utah with her husband, their three children, and a perpetually muddy dog.Gr 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;A fantastical alternate history set in ancient Rome. Nicolas Calva and his sister are slaves in the mines outside of Rome. When Nic is forced to retrieve treasure from Julius Caesar's cave, he assumes he is going to his death. But inside the cave he finds a bulla, a magical amulet thought to have given Caesar great power, and takes it for himself. Suddenly, Nic is the most wanted fugitive in Rome. The emperor and a powerful general are after the amulet and they will kill Nic to get it. His only help is Aurelia, a plebian girl who is searching for her own family. With no one to trust and nowhere to hide, the protagonist must decide how he is going to save his sister and get out with his life. He doesn't want the bulla or the responsibility of the magic it contains, but if the magical object gets into the wrong hands, Rome will be at war and Nic will be at the center of it all. Fans of Nielsen's "Ascendance" trilogy (Scholastic) will be clamoring for this new series. This genre mash-up of history, fantasy, and action/adventure is fast-paced and explores themes such as class struggles, familial ties, and the immorality of slavery.

She wants to be someone people admire and respect. She wants to be loved. But her secret, shameful needs have forced her into exile. She hates herself for the <i>bad</i> thing she does, for what it's done to her family and her sense of identity; for how it dictates her place in the world and how people see her--how they judge her. She didn't choose to be this way. </p><p>Because Maren Yearly doesn't just break hearts, she devours them. Ever since her mother found Penny Wilson's eardrum in her mouth when Maren was just two years old, she knew life would never be normal for either of them.

But soon after he arrives, he crosses paths with Emmett Till, a black teenager from Chicago who is also visiting for the summer. Hiram sees firsthand how the local whites mistreat blacks who refuse to "know their place." When Emmett's tortured dead body is found floating in a river, Hiram is determined to find out who could do such a thing. But what will it cost him to know?</p><p>Chris Crowe is the author of several books, most notably <i>Mississippi Trial, 1955,</i> which won several awards, including the 2003 International Reading Association's Young Adult Novel Award. His nonfiction book, <i>Getting Away with Murder: The True Story of the Emmett Till Case</i>, was an Jane Addams Honor book. His first children's book, <i>Just As Good: How Larry Doby Changed America's Game</i>, appeared in 2012. Chris married his high school sweetheart, and they live in Provo, Utah, where he works in the English department at BYU. They are the parents of four children and grandparents of two lovely girls and three handsome boys.Grade 6-8-While visiting relatives in Mississippi, Emmett Till, 14, spoke "ugly" to a white woman and was subsequently tortured and murdered. Two men were arrested and tried for this heinous crime, but in spite of substantial evidence, were found not guilty. Crowe has woven the plot of his novel around these historical events. Hiram, the fictional main character, had lived with his grandparents in Mississippi as a child. Now 16, he returns to visit his aging grandfather, where he meets Emmett Till. He also renews a childhood acquaintance with R.C. Rydell, a redneck bully. When Emmett's mutilated body is found, Hiram immediately suspects that R.C. was involved. In a predictable twist at the end, he learns that it was his grandfather, not R.C., who helped the murderers. The Deep South setting is well realized. Descriptions of the climate, food, and landscape are vivid and on target. Likewise, Southern racial attitudes from the period are accurately portrayed. Grampa is a racist but Hiram enables readers to see his good qualities as well. Hiram himself seems rather naive. He is unable to fathom the racial prejudice at the root of his father's alienation from his grandfather. Nor does he feel the aura of racial fear and hatred that hangs over the entire region. The novel succeeds in telling Emmett Till's story, but there is an emotional distance that keeps readers from caring as deeply as they should about this crime. Still, it is a story that needs to be told. This book belongs in all collections to show young readers the full range of American history.<br><i>Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, NC</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Program Administration Scale (PAS): Measuring Early Childhood Leadership and Management</h2><p><p>Research has consistently found that effective administrative practices are crucial for ensuring beneficial program outcomes for children and families.

With its endearing, courageous heroine, cheerful humor, and wonderful, whimsical drawings of Paris, the Madeline stories are true classics that continue to charm readers even after 75 years!<br><br>When Madeline falls into the river Seine and nearly drowns, a courageous canine comes to her rescue. Now Genevieve the dog is Madeline's cherished pet, and the envy of all the other girls. What can be done when there's just not enough hound to go around?<br><br>Ludwig Bemelmans (1898-1962) was the author of the beloved Madeline books, including&nbsp;<i>Madeline</i>, a Caldecott Honor Book, and&nbsp;<i>Madeline's Rescue</i>, winner of the Caldecott Medal.</p><p>It took Ludwig Bemelmans years to think of Madeline's next adventure after the 1939 original <i>Madeline</i>, but he did it, and the result was <i>Madeline's Rescue</i>, winner of the 1954 Caldecott Medal. One day on a walk through Paris (a "twelve little girls in two straight lines" kind of walk), Madeline slips and falls off a bridge right into the Seine. Everyone feared she would be dead, "But for a dog / That kept its head," saving her from a "watery grave." What choice do Madeline and the girls have but to take the heroic pooch home, feed her biscuits, milk, and beef, and name her Genevieve? Sadly, when Lord Cucuface gets wind of the new dog, he decrees that no dogs will be allowed in the "old house in Paris that was covered with vines," and kicks Genevieve out on the street. Madeline vows vengeance, and the girls scour Paris looking for the pup: "They went looking high / and low / And every place a dog might go. / In every place they called her name / But no one answered to the same." As we've come to expect from Bemelmans, all's well that ends well chez Clavel, and young readers will be tickled by this heartwarming, quirky dog story with a surprise finale.

She has awoken into a darkness she does not understand, scarred from a terrible battle, only to find that life at Biltmore Estate has changed in unimaginable ways. Old friends do unthinkable things and enemies seem all around.<br>A mysterious threat moves towards Biltmore, a force without a name, bringing with it violent storms and flooding that stands to uproot everything in its path. Serafina must uncover the truth about what has happened to her and find a way to harness her strange new powers before it's too late. <br>With only days to achieve the impossible, Serafina fights to reclaim herself as the Guardian of Biltmore, friend of Braeden, daughter of her Pa, and heroine of the Blue Ridge Mountains and all the folk and creatures that call it home. <br>In the epic third installment of Robert Beatty's #1 bestselling series, Serafina takes her rightful place among literary champions as she battles fiercely to defend all she loves and become everything that she is meant to be.</p><p>Robert Beatty lives in the mountains of Asheville, North Carolina, with his wife and three daughters. He writes full-time now, but in his past lives he was one of the pioneers of cloud computing, the founder/CEO of Plex Systems, the co-founder of Beatty Robotics, and the CTO and chairman of <i>Narrative </i>magazine. Visit him online at www.robert-beatty.com. <p></p>Gr 5&#x2013;7&#x2014;In this third installment of the series, readers find Serafina and her friends meeting their biggest challenge yet: supernatural powers bent on destroying Biltmore forest and the historic Biltmore home and all its inhabitants. Twelve-year-old Serafina is on her own; the resourceful friends she gained in the first two novels are mysteriously absent. Readers of the previous installments may not be surprised that the narrative revisits the black cloak that "just won't stay gone," and they will revel in the cloak's latest reincarnation. Serafina eventually discovers her best friend, Braeden, and his trusty Doberman, Gidean, in residence at her beloved Biltmore Estate&#x2014;yet he cannot see or hear Serafina. She also wonders about the odd passage of time since she had previously seen her friends. Serafina does finally learn what mysterious power has prevented her from communicating with her friends, and they once again are able to form an alliance against the evil sorcerer. Beatty does a fairly good job of summarizing previous goings-on, but kids should read the series in order. Along with empowering themes about friendship, choosing right over wrong, and perseverance, Beatty again crafts a dark fantasy with bone-chilling imagery, suspense, and unique supernatural elements. VERDICT This compelling continuation of the intriguing series revisits puzzling themes, multifaceted characters, and nonstop action, all set against the beautiful Biltmore locale in Asheville, NC. Hand this title to fans of Kevin Sand's The Blackthorn Key, Chris D'Lacey's "The UNICORNE Files," or Tony DiTerlizzi's "The Spiderwick Chronicles."&#x2014;Julie Shatterly, W.A. Bess Elementary School, Gastonia, NC</p><h2>Lost in the Pacific, 1942: Not a Drop to Drink</h2><p><b>LOST IN THE PACIFIC is the first book in a new narrative nonfiction series that tells the true story of a band of World War II soldiers who became stranded at sea and had to fight for survival.</b><br><br>World War II, October 21, 1942. A B-17 bomber drones high over the Pacific Ocean, sending a desperate SOS into the air. The crew is carrying America's greatest living war hero on a secret mission deep into the battle zone. But the plane is lost, burning through its final gallons of fuel.<br><br>At 1:30 p.m., there is only one choice left: an emergency landing at sea. If the crew survives the impact, they will be left stranded without food or water hundreds of miles from civilization. <br><br>Eight men. Three inflatable rafts. Sixty-eight million square miles of ocean. What will it take to make it back alive?</p><p>Tod Olson is the author of the Lost series, the How to Get Rich historical fiction series, and numerous books for the school/library and classroom markets. He has written for national magazines on the Columbine school shooting, homeless teens, the murder of Matthew Shepard, and many other stories of interest to children and young adults. During his 25 years in children&#39;s publishing, he has edited and developed several collections of books for both school/library and the classroom. Tod holds an MFA from Vermont College.Gr 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;The date is October 21, 1942, and somewhere over the Pacific Ocean a lone B-17 runs low on fuel. In order to avert a crash, the pilot and copilot choose to attempt to land the plane on the surface of the ocean amid 20-foot swells. They are successful, and thus begins the survival struggle of eight men in three tiny life rafts. Olson skillfully tells of the physical and mental torture the men endured, floating for 22 days with no protection from the elements and with limited amounts of food and water (two oranges, a small bird, a few fish, and a little bit of rainwater). Much of the narration focuses on Col. Eddie Rickenbacker's role in the men's survival. Some of the crew were eventually spotted and rescued by a search plane, while others were saved by people from the island of Funafuti. Only one did not survive the ordeal. The clearly written text is engaging and accompanied by numerous black-and-white photos. However, one sentence erroneously states that the president, not Congress, declared war. Clippings from newspapers and magazines are included in the back matter. VERDICT A great choice for collections in need of World War II survival stories for middle schoolers.&#x2014;Eldon Younce, Anthony Public Library, KS</p><h2>Ten Days in A Mad-House: Illustrated and Annotated: A First-Hand Account of Life At Bellevue Hospital on Blackwell&#39;s Island in 1887</h2><p>Ten Days in A Mad-House, Was Written By Nellie Bly in 1887, after she lived, undercover, at a women's insane asylum at Blackwell's Island in 1887 for ten days.

Rendering is the next step after drawing to communicate ideas more clearly. Building on what Scott Robertson and Thomas Bertling wrote about in How To Draw: Drawing and Sketching Objects and Environments from Your Imagination, this book shares everything the two experts know about how to render light, shadow and reflective surfaces. This book is divided into two major sections: the first explains the physics of light and shadow. One will learn how to construct proper shadows in perspective and how to apply the correct values to those surfaces. The second section focuses on the physics of reflectivity and how to render a wide range of materials utilizing this knowledge. Throughout the book, two icons appear that indicate either &#x201c;observation&#x201d; or &#x201c;action.&#x201d; This means the page or section is about observing reality or taking action by applying the knowledge and following the steps in creating your own work. Similar to our previous book, How To Draw, this book contains links to free online rendering tutorials that can be accessed via the URL list or through the H2Re app.</p><p>Scott Robertson has almost two decades of experience teaching how to design, draw, and render at the highest college level. He has authored or co-authored 11 books on design and concept art. In addition to books, he has co-produced over 40 educational DVDs with The Gnomon Workshop, of which nine feature his own lectures. For several years, Scott chaired the Entertainment Design department at Art Center College of Design. He frequently lectures around the world for various corporations, colleges, and through his own workshop brand, SRW. In addition to teaching, Scott has worked on a wide variety of projects ranging from vehicle and alien designs for the Hot Wheels animated series Battle Force Five, to theme park attractions such as the Men in Black ride in Orlando, Florida for Universal Studios. Some of his clients include the BMW subsidiary Design-works/USA, Bell Sports, Giro, Mattel Toys, Spin Master Toys, Patagonia, the feature film Minority Report, Nike, Rockstar Games, Sony Online Entertainment, Sony Computer Entertainment of America, Buena Vista Games, THQ, and Fiat to name just a few.<br><br>Thomas Bertling has an extensive background as a successful industrial designer and engineer, with a varied array of clients such as Disney, Samsung, and Whole Foods, and a diverse portfolio of completed products on the market, from state-of-the-art medical innovations to combat-ready military vehicles. This hands-on expertise gives him a distinct approach and remarkable edge in addition to being an acclaimed design educator.

The deck and book set comes with the Rider-Waite Tarot deck by Pamela Colman Smith with original Tudor Rose back design, Celtic Cross divinatory chart, and The Key to the Tarot by Arthur Edward Waite.</p><p>A.E. Waite (Author) Arthur Edward Waite was the designer and co-creator of the now famous Rider Waite Tarot deck. An American-born British poet and scholarly mystic, his strong interest in all esoteric matters - divination, magic, Kabbalism, alchemy and Freemasony - led to him penning a number of books. These include the Key to the Tarot, The Book of Ceremonial Magic and A New Encyclopedia of Freemasony.Pamela Colman Smith (Illustrator) Pamela Colman Smith was born in England to American parents. Her childhood years were spent between London, New York and Kingston, Jamaica. She became a theatrical designer, even collaborating with the notable W.B. Yeats on stage designs. She was an illustrator mainly of books, pamphlets and posters too. Under the guidance of A. E. Waite, she undertook a series of seventy-eight allegorical paintings described by Waite as a &#39;rectified&#39; tarot pack. The designs, published in the same year by William Rider and Son, exemplify the mysticism, ritual, imagination, fantasy and deep emotions of the artist.In 1909, Arthur Edward Waite encouraged Pamela Colman Smith to produce a tarot deck with appeal to the world of art that would have significance behind the symbols, and thus make the deck more important than tarot packs previously used for centuries. The result was the unique Rider-Waite Tarot deck which has endured as the world's most popular 78-card tarot deck. The innovative cards, including the 56 Minor Arcana, depict full scenes with figures and symbols. This featured, combined with Pamela Smith's ability to capture the subtleties of emotion and experience, has made the Rider-Waite Tarot the basis for the designs of many 20th Century packs. The Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack is a facsimile edition originally printed from palates that were destroyed during the bombing of London during World War II. The deck and book set comes complete and in full-color with original Tudor Rose back design, Celtic Cross divinatory chart, and The Key to the Tarot by Arthur Waite. --<i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Legend of Drizzt 25th Anniversary Edition, Book I</h2><p>The legend starts here!<br><br><b>The Legend of Drizzt</b>�&nbsp;25th Anniversary&nbsp;Edition, Book I collects the first three novels in this best-selling series: <i>Homeland, Exile,</i> and <i>Sojourn</i> in a new trade paperback edition.

People are the ultimate performance variable, and understanding how to effectively blend knowledge of proper training with the nuances of human behavior is integral to helping athletes achieve their ultimate goals. Unfortunately, while much attention has been given to the science of physical training, little attention has been given to the science of communication. Conscious Coaching: The Art and Science of Building Buy-In bridges this gap. Readers learn the foundational principles of improving relationships, enhancing engagement, and gaining the trust of athletes through targeted communication. And, every bit as important, readers also learn concrete strategies to apply these principles in day-to-day coaching situations they will inevitably encounter. The result is a game-changing book that sets the stage for coaches to create a culture of success not only within sport, but also beyond. Conscious Coaching is a movement and its time has come.</p><p>Brett Bartholomew is a strength and conditioning coach, best-selling author, adjunct professor, and Founder of the performance coaching and consulting company, The Bridge Human Performance(R). His experience includes working with world-class athletes in both the team setting (NCAA and professional), as well as individually along with members of the United States Special Forces community and Fortune 500 companies. Taken together, Brett has coached a diverse range of athletes from across 23 sports at levels ranging from youth to Olympians. He's supported Super Bowl and World Series Champions, along with several professional fighters, including those competing in the UFC. His coaching and speaking has spanned the globe, from China to Brazil and numerous other stops in between.

Athletes want a coach that not only makes them better physically, but also one that understands our world and communicates in a real way- Brett does that. For me it's about the combination of smart training and good communication, and what I love and most of all is he is not just my coach, he is my friend. I'll be working with him until my career is over.&nbsp;<b>- Patrick Chung / Two-time Super Bowl Champion / Safety - New England Patriots</b></li></ul><ul><li>Brett Bartholomew is one of the leaders of our profession today. He understands that the strength &amp; conditioning industry is part 'art' and part 'science'. We live in a world today where we have many internet 'gurus' that get the science, understand the physiology and biomechanics. However, the defining element of 'coaching' lies in a coach's ability to interact with an athlete or group of athletes -- understand where they are at, and how to motivate and move a group of athletes forward. Brett's book will give you some insight into the 'art' of how to do this. Creating the environment to teach, motivate, and inspire is a 'must' in today's modern coaching world. Anyone that has seen Brett coach live, or otherwise, sees his passion and energy immediately. Young coaches starting their journey into this profession (or anyone who's been in for years) would do well to soak up the experiences and learn the applied side of coaching. I can't recommend Brett's book enough.

He enters a car race, of course! Readers will love this fast-paced, fact-based story!</p><p>Monica Kulling is an award-winning author of over fifty books for children, including picture books, biographies, and many Step Into Reading titles,&nbsp;the most recent being&nbsp;<i>Sky High: George Ferris's Big Wheel.</i>&nbsp;She lives in Toronto, Ontario.Gr. 1-2. Readers get a taste of history plus plenty of action in this lively entry in the Step into Reading series, which will have great appeal for boys. Color artwork, full of exaggeration, movement, and comical detail, catches the fun and excitement of Ford's history-making auto-race defeat of Alexander Winton, which brought in enough cash to allow Ford to start his famous company. The story has no chapter breaks to give newer readers a breather, but the type is large and well spaced, and the action is so involving, especially after the race starts, that kids won't want to stop reading until Ford crosses the finish line.

The sky above the woods glowed blue, and the leaves on the trees were a riot of fall colors: sunshine yellow, campfire orange, blood red.</p><p>In a grassy clearing, a small group of American soldiers quickly built a gallows. It was a simple structure, made of two tall, forked logs stuck into the ground, with a third log laid horizontally between the forks. The soldiers tied one end of a rope to the middle of the horizontal log, letting the other end hang down. There was no platform to stand on, no trapdoor to fall through&#x2014;the prisoner would have to climb onto a wagon with the rope looped around his throat. Horses would jerk the wagon forward, and he would tumble off the back. The force of his falling weight should be enough to snap a man&#x2019;s neck.</p><p>As the soldiers worked, a crowd began to gather. Officers rode up and sat still on their horses. Soldiers and citizens from nearby towns gradually filled the clearing. By late afternoon, hundreds of people surrounded the gallows, and thousands lined the road leading to it. It was a somber crowd. People spoke in whispers, if at all.</p><p>Shortly before five o&#x2019;clock, a wagon carrying a plain, pine coffin rattled along the road and into the clearing. The driver stopped his horses just beyond the gallows, with the wagon lined up under the dangling rope. The ghoulish figure of a hangman appeared, his face sloppily smeared with black axle grease to disguise his identity. He stood by the wagon and waited.</p><p>A few minutes after five, the distant sounds of a fife and drum band reached the clearing. The music grew louder, and the crowd recognized the tune&#x2014;a funeral march. Soon the players came into view, stepping slowly and heavily in time with the music.</p><p>Behind the band marched the prisoner. He wore a spotless officer&#x2019;s uniform, his long hair pulled back and tied neatly behind his neck. When he reached the clearing he saw the gallows and stopped. The color drained from his skin. He swallowed, making a visibly painful effort to force the saliva down his throat. Then he began marching again, walking steadily toward his death.</p><p>But this is the end of the story. The story begins thirty-nine years earlier and 125 miles to the east, in the busy port town of Norwich, Connecticut. The story begins with Benedict Arnold.</p><p>THE NOTORIOUS BENEDICT ARNOLD Copyright � 2010 by Steve Sheinkin</p></p><h2>Van Gogh: 16 Art Stickers (Dover Art Stickers)</h2><p><p>Widely regarded as the greatest and most revolutionary of Dutch artists after Rembrandt, Vincent van Gogh (1835&#x2013;1890) produced hundreds of drawings and oil paintings during his brief career as an artist.

Although he received a Masters Degree in Social Sciences and never formally studied literature or creative writing, he began to consider himself a "writer" about the time he graduated from college. After college, he became a dancer in a modern dance company and worked at numerous low-paying jobs as a laborer or counselor. However, during this 20-year period, London continued to write. He wrote poems and short stories for adults, earning next to nothing despite being published in many literary magazines. "It wasn't until I had kids of my own that I became a writer for children," he explains. "It all started with telling them stories when they were very young. I wrote down one of these stories, and it became&nbsp;<i>The Owl Who Became the Moon</i>, my first picture book sale (though it was my fourth to appear in print). Now I am finally making a living as a writer. A dream come true!" Born a "Navy brat" in Brooklyn, New York,&nbsp;London was raised on naval stations throughout the US and Puerto Rico.

To add to his excitement, he receives a new horn, his first Christmas present ever. His joy is short-lived, however, when, in the middle of a snowy night, he overhears that the mare is sick: "We need Doc Baker out here tonight or we'll lose 'em both!" When the farmhand sent to get Doc plunges into a snowdrift during the raging storm, Otis, as always, comes to the rescue, setting out "with snow up to his chin." He gets lost in the woods only to discover that he is perched on the precipice of a hill. Bravely heading down a steep, slippery branch, he reaches the doctor's house, alerts him with his horn, and brings him back to save the day. The grayish-blue hues that predominate in Long's lovely, large-framed illustrations create a sense of cold stillness. Executed in gouache and pencil, they depict the red tractor in sharp contrast to countryside and woods blanketed in deep snow. There are few surprises here, and the tree branch jutting from the hill seems forced. Traveling down the branch leads Otis a bit too conveniently almost to Doc Baker's door. Otis's fans may turn to this one, but it is an additional purchase.-Marianne Saccardi, formerly at Norwalk Community College, CT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013. Library Journal.

He was fresh from yet another week of being a counselor at a summer YMCA camp. I marveled at how quickly the years have passed and here he was&#x2014;twenty years old and about to enter his junior year in college. Could it possibly be?<br><br>&#x201c;Mom, I have to tell you something.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;ve learned to appreciate every opportunity to talk about his life, so I stopped what I was doing and listened.<br><br>&#x201c;The camp kids were driving me crazy. I was so frustrated, I was ready to scream.&#x201d; He paused and put his finger in the air to make a pronouncement. &#x201c;So, I decided I&#x2019;d better read one of your books.&#x201d;<br><br>I raised my eyebrows. &#x201c;Which book did you read, Mike?&#x201d; He shrugged and grinned. &#x201c;<i>You Can&#x2019;t Make Me</i>.&#x201d; Before I<br>could react he rushed on. &#x201c;And you know what? It works!" I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for this. Was this my strong-willed child,<br>who appears in every chapter of the book, telling me he was now using it to understand the kids he was counseling at<br>camp?<br><br>For the next twenty minutes Mike regaled me with examples he had read in the book, emphasizing the strategies he had used successfully with his campers. We reminisced over stories from the book that he remembered and laughed about the ones he had forgotten or was too young to recall.<br><br>Since the first edition of <i>You Can&#x2019;t Make Me! (But I Can Be Persuaded)</i> came out in 1999, literally thousands of parents and educators have taken the time to actually write or personally deliver overwhelmingly positive and grateful responses to the powerful and effective strategies in the book. I&#x2019;ve been humbled and encouraged to see the hope in their eyes and hear the joy in their voices.<br><br>But I have to tell you, by far the most meaningful endorsement I could ask for is the one from Mike. After twenty years of living with and loving my strong-willed child, after the prayers and tears, trial and error, perseverance and frustration, failure and success, he is reading and endorsing the book that describes him as the quintessential strong-willed kid.<br><br>So as you read this revised and updated version of <i>You Can&#x2019;t Make Me</i>, believe me when I say I&#x2019;m still in the trenches with you. I&#x2019;ve parented a great strong-willed child and his equally wonderful but more compliant twin brother. I will never be able to make the claim I did everything right. Far from it! I am eternally grateful that God has been gracious in supplementing my well-intentioned and often inadequate efforts with His grace, love, and wisdom.<br><br>My fervent prayer is that you will benefit from the wisdom and advice of the many strong-willed children and their parents you are about to meet in this book. Most of all, no matter how things turn out, I pray you will be glad you never gave up on the relationship with your strong-willed child. You&#x2019;ll never be able to truly measure the difference it will make.</p><h2>Astral Dynamics: The Complete Book of Out-of-Body Experiences</h2><p><p>Astral projection is a technique that lets your soul explore the universe while leaving your body behind.

According to the ancient historian Josephus, two women and five children survived. Based on this tragic and iconic event, Hoffman&#x2019;s novel is a spellbinding tale of four extraordinarily bold, resourceful, and sensuous women, each of whom has come to Masada by a different path. Yael&#x2019;s mother died in childbirth, and her father, an expert assassin, never forgave her for that death. Revka, a village baker&#x2019;s wife, watched the murder of her daughter by Roman soldiers; she brings to Masada her young grandsons, rendered mute by what they have witnessed. Aziza is a warrior&#x2019;s daughter, raised as a boy, a fearless rider and expert marksman who finds passion with a fellow soldier. Shirah, born in Alexandria, is wise in the ways of ancient magic and medicine, a woman with uncanny insight and power.<br> <br>The lives of these four complex and fiercely independent women intersect in the desperate days of the siege. All are dovekeepers, and all are also keeping secrets&#x2014;about who they are, where they come from, who fathered them, and whom they love.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> Yael was born of a dead mother and father who knows how to become invisible. Revka learned silence when her grandsons lost their voices after witnessing their mother&#x2019;s brutal murder. Aziza became a boy to protect herself, and hates being forced to turn back into a woman. And Shirah will do anything to protect those she loves from the horrors of the world. The power and violence of these women is evident in every word of <i>The Dovekeepers</i>. Hoffman&#x2019;s prose is vivid and unforgettable, scorching like the desert heat, and will stay with you long after you finish the last page. A story of sacrifice, endurance, and above all, survival, <i>The Dovekeepers</i> is homage to anyone who&#x2019;s ever held fast to their beliefs in the face of nearly insurmountable adversity. <i>--Malissa Kent</i>Alice Hoffman is the author of more than thirty works of fiction, including <i>The Marriage of Opposites</i>, <i>Practical Magic</i>,<i> The Red Garden</i>, the Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club selection <i>Here on Earth</i>, <i>The Museum of Extraordinary Things</i>, and <i>The Dovekeepers</i>.

The Attachment, Regulation, and Competency (ARC) framework can be used with children, parents, and other caregivers in a wide range of settings. The volume guides the clinician to identify key treatment goals and intervene flexibly to strengthen child&#x2013;caregiver relationships and support healthy development and positive functioning.

They are coauthors of the foster parent curriculum <i>ARC Reflections</i> and the caregiver skill building curriculum <i>ARC Grow</i>."This book is rooted in a lucid understanding of developmental and attachment processes and the impact that trauma has on them. Described in a way that reflects years of clinical experience, the interventions are sensitive to the complexities of clinical work with children, and provide guidance for working with caregivers, families, and systems of care. The book is encyclopedic--it is chock-full of information on everything from developmental theory to therapist self-care, matching interventions to patient needs, and implementation strategies."--Marylene Cloitre, PhD, Associate Director of Research, National Center for PTSD Dissemination and Training Division; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University<br><br> "Confronted with the suffering of a child exposed to stress and adversity, it is easy for a clinician to become overwhelmed, unsure where to even begin addressing the complexly troubled and often chaotic lives of the child and his or her caregiving system. The ARC framework avoids doing what is all too common--simply affixing a diagnostic label to a traumatized child and providing a referral to a physician for medication. In clear, accessible, and direct language, using case illustrations, the authors present an integrative framework for addressing complex developmental trauma and the behaviors that signify it. ARC respects the art of therapeutic intervention while offering concrete goals, strategies, and interventions to guide the process of treatment toward health and well-being."--Sandra L. Bloom, MD, Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University<br><br> "The second edition of this extraordinary volume offers an even more integrated and comprehensive resource. The authors have fine-tuned the ARC framework, seamlessly linking theory and practice, individuals and systems, the needs and resources of children and their caregivers, behavior and triggers, and problems and solutions. They know what makes these kids tick--and how to help them. ARC is a practical, reassuring, step-wise approach that helps us to increase our own capacity for attachment, regulation, and competence as we do the same for dysregulated kids and their overwhelmed systems. If you have reached an impasse with a distressed child in the home, office, school, or treatment center, or if you need just the right handout, activity, worksheet, session tracking checklist, or educational resource to support traumatized children and caregivers, this essential book is for you."--Martha B. Straus, PhD, Department of Clinical Psychology, Antioch University New England<br><br> "The second edition of this excellent treatment guide provides cutting-edge information on working with children who have been exposed to complex developmental trauma and their caregivers. Adaptable for a variety of settings, ARC offers detailed strategies that increase the child&#x2019;s integration of traumatic experiences and the caregiver&#x2019;s capacities to nurture, parent, and provide optimal attachment experiences. Theoretical concepts are illustrated throughout by case examples, and are linked to extensive practical material on the core domains of attachment, regulation, and competency. This book represents an important contribution to the child trauma field and is highly recommended for new and experienced clinicians alike."--Cheryl Lanktree, PhD, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California<br><br> "An excellent resource for professionals in both clinical and educational settings. Blaustein and Kinniburgh effectively explain the complexity of developmental trauma, its impact on youth, and the need for individualized treatment, and present their ARC framework. The second edition elaborates on applications of ARC outside traditional clinical settings. It provides useful tools for professionals working with traumatized children, including downloadable activities and worksheets. Graduate students in school psychology, school counseling, pediatric neuropsychology, and clinical child psychology will benefit from reading this book in classes and using it as a resource in their future careers."--Terry Diamanduros, PhD, School Psychology Program, Georgia Southern University<br><br>"A comprehensive, practical guide....I would highly recommend [it] to anyone interested in the field."

Murrow Award for Best Newscast in America&#x201c;I truly appreciate the way Hershfield conveys complex constructs in the simplest terms. He humanizes the disorder with just enough humor to take the edge off, but not too much to negate the pain for all those affected. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) hijacks the brain and robs a giving, selfless human being of their humanity, rendering them to a seemingly selfish and entitled individual. OCD is the diagnosis given to an individual; however, it affects those in close emotional proximity to the person diagnosed. Hershfield is able to &#x2018;cut to the chase&#x2019; and not engage in endless psychobabble leaving the reader confused. Quite honestly, I find it a must-read for family and friends involved with someone diagnosed with OCD.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Shana Doronn, LCSW, PsyD</b>, doctor of psychology in the Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Intensive Treatment Program at the University of California, Los Angeles, and featured therapist on A&amp;E&#x2019;s <i>Obsessed</i><br><br>&#x201c;Every day at work I meet with individuals who have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

He explains obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a way that is accessible to anyone, and then lays out in a very readable manner how family members should react to their loved one&#x2019;s illness and what role they should play during treatment.

And until now, it was one of the more boring, meaningless assignments.

For him, the Constitution is "a kind of how-to book, showing us ways to have happiness, safety, and comfort." With laugh-out-loud cartoony illustrations, and the actual words of the Preamble as the only text, Catrow depicts a camping trip taken by a diverse, bumbling group of friends, demonstrating the rights and responsibilities the Constitution places on all Americans, young and old. In one especially winning picture, the kids' long-nosed, long-eared pooch provides "for the common defense," keeping lackadaisical guard over the camp as the three human friends yuk it up in silhouette inside the tent.

Yet away from the spotlight, Alicia has grappled with private heartache&#x2015;over the challenging and complex relationship with her father, the people-pleasing nature that characterized her early career, the loss of privacy surrounding her romantic relationships, and the oppressive expectations of female perfection. </p><p>Since her rise to fame, Alicia&#x2019;s public persona has belied a deep personal truth: she has spent years not fully recognizing or honoring her own worth. After withholding parts of herself for so long, she is at last exploring the questions that live at the heart of her story: Who am I, really? And once I discover that truth, how can I become brave enough to embrace it?</p><p><i>More</i> <i>Myself</i> is part autobiography, part narrative documentary.

Instead, it&#x2019;s about instilling values that have been proven to make people successful&#x2014;not just financially, but in life: delaying gratification, working hard, living within your means, getting a good education, and acting generously toward others.

Whether the subject terrifies you or intrigues you, or you&#x2019;re simply looking for ways to broach the topic, the good news is that you&#x2019;re plunging in. Go, you!<br> <br>A few quick words about this chapter. Though its title might make it sound like I&#x2019;m expecting you to be a financial drill sergeant (&#x201c;Now drop and give me twenty compound-interest calculations!&#x201d;), I&#x2019;m not. This chapter is the gentle one, meant to ease you into some overall concepts&#x2014;and context&#x2014;that&#x2019;ll help you engage with your child about money. Some points will apply, others might not, depending on your kid&#x2019;s age, interest level, and even gender. So don&#x2019;t think that you need to commit everything to memory or take furious notes. The idea here is to put down your highlighter and just read.<br> <br>One final thought before we begin: Money conversations don&#x2019;t happen in a vacuum. Instead, they pop up at various times throughout the messy business of living. Though it&#x2019;s become a clich�, most learning happens during these everyday &#x201c;teachable moments.&#x201d; The tips below and throughout this book are meant to help you take advantage of these opportunities.<br> <br>So here we go.<br> <br>1 Start even earlier than you think you should. By the ripe old age of three, researchers at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison report, many children are able to grasp economic ideas such as value and exchange, albeit in a very rudimentary way. They can also delay gratification and make choices. Though basic, all these concepts are important in understanding the role of money in our daily lives. Although there&#x2019;s no economic equivalent of Baby Mozart videos, no stuffed dolls that look like Warren Buffett to tell your kid to &#x201c;buy low and sell high&#x201d; when you squeeze them, that doesn&#x2019;t mean you shouldn&#x2019;t pay attention to this stuff when your child is small.<br> <br>Your toddler is eager, and able, to understand a lot. When you notice your little one &#x201c;swiping&#x201d; a pretend credit card, asking to push the buttons at the ATM, or looking through your wallet, instead of chuckling indulgently in a &#x201c;kids say the darndest things&#x201d; way, start teaching him some of the basic lessons in this book about where money comes from and how to pay for things. Even if your preschooler doesn&#x2019;t absorb it all, he will still notice that you&#x2019;re talking to him about something that matters&#x2014;something grown-ups care about. And odds are, he&#x2019;s already soaking up more than you think.<br> <br>2 Keep it age appropriate. Sticking to the truth is good when it comes to money, but so is adapting your message to your kid&#x2019;s level. If you lose your job, it&#x2019;s fine to say to your elementary schooler, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to cook at home more, since that costs less than eating out.&#x201d; Skip the part about being in such dire straits that you&#x2019;re dipping into your 401(k) to make ends meet. Given the same scenario but with a kid in high school, talking about how the loss of an income will affect college financing would be not only acceptable but also wise. You can discuss the reality that your family might not be able to put as much toward college expenses, but at the same time explain that she might qualify for more financial aid. In general, when it comes to having any hard money talk with your kid, it&#x2019;s good to tell it like it is, but also offer reassurance that she&#x2014;and you&#x2014;will be okay.<br> <br>3 Use anecdotes. More often than not, when we launch into lecture mode, our kids tune out. Or, worse, our pontificate-y good intentions backfire and push our children to do the opposite of what we&#x2019;re trying to get them to do. Instead, use stories to illustrate a point. When my friend couldn&#x2019;t get a decent rate on a car loan because she&#x2019;d run up too much debt on her credit card on a monthlong, over-the-top European trip the year before, I told my kids the details (without mentioning her name). Anecdotes such as these, which highlight how financial blunders lead to consequences, tend to stick in kids&#x2019; minds. Same is true of positive lessons, like an example of the neighbor who saved religiously for ten years, putting aside 1% of every paycheck, so that he could finally buy his dream fishing boat. You get the idea.<br> <br>4 Use numbers, even if you&#x2019;re mathphobic. People understand money concepts better when a point is made with specific numbers. Saying to your kid, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so important to put money into your 401(k) even when you&#x2019;re young,&#x201d; is much less effective than offering an example. &#x201c;If you put $315 every month into a 401(k) starting at age twenty-two, by the time you reach age sixty-five, you could have more than a million dollars.&#x201d; (The very words million dollars invariably make kids take notice.) If you have no idea where to get the numbers to show your kid, use some of the examples from this book or, if you&#x2019;re feeling ambitious, check out the simple online financial calculators on a website such as Moneychimp.com. (I used a compound-interest calculator to crunch the numbers for the example above, and I promise it&#x2019;s easy. Really.)<br> <br>5 Don&#x2019;t lie about your money past&#x2014;but don&#x2019;t overshare, either. Most of us have had a flirtation with bad money management at some point, whether we ran up too much on a credit card or bounced a check or two (or ten). But resist the urge to come clean about your money mistakes to purge your own feelings of guilt or irresponsibility: Your kid isn&#x2019;t your financial advisor&#x2014;or your priest. Take a page from the latest research on talking to kids about drugs, which shows that parents who have themselves indulged in the past should not go into details with their kids. If you&#x2019;re answering a direct question, definitely pick and choose which financial sins you disclose; tales of emptying your bank account for a road trip with an old boyfriend or blowing through your 401(k) savings to fund a wacky business scheme may glamorize what were actually regrettable decisions that took you many years to overcome.<br> <br>6 Never fib about how much money you have on you. This is something that nearly all harried parents do at some point. Whether our wallets are full or empty, in the heat of the parenting moment, it is natural to want to lie a little to avoid tantrums when passing our kid&#x2019;s favorite stores or during difficult checkout-line discussions. Try not to. Although it might seem harmless to tell a young child, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any money with me, so I can&#x2019;t buy you that bag of gummy bears,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s better to say something like, &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think we need to spend money on that now. Besides, the dentist told us to avoid chewy sweets.&#x201d; Straight talk is a good example to set, and if there are real reasons behind your decisions, it&#x2019;s actually helpful to share them with your child. If what your kid wants simply isn&#x2019;t in your budget, say so and explain why. Or if you oppose the purchase for some other reason (say, you don&#x2019;t want your kid toting a bazooka water gun around the neighborhood), then explain that, too. Remember that children are smart and won&#x2019;t just settle for &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t afford it,&#x201d; which, surveys show, kids mostly don&#x2019;t believe anyway. No matter what your reasons, saying that you don&#x2019;t have cash won&#x2019;t work, since kids know there are lots of ways to pay for things. If you swipe your credit card a few minutes after pleading poverty, you&#x2019;ll be busted. Once you get caught in a lie, your child will always wonder if you can be trusted. It&#x2019;s just not worth it. Bite the bullet at the point of purchase now, and it won&#x2019;t bite you in the backside later.<br> <br>7 Identify your financial baggage&#x2014;then leave it behind. Nina, now in her midthirties, used to tell anyone who&#x2019;d listen, including her kids, that her &#x201c;inability to do money,&#x201d; as she put it, is due to her parents&#x2019; financial ineptitude. &#x201c;They knew nothing about budgeting, never saved, and lived life in a completely irresponsible way,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. I also know people who tell me the opposite: They&#x2019;re bad with money because their parents were so controlling and frugal, and they promised themselves that they wouldn&#x2019;t live that way when they were parents. Here&#x2019;s the point: It&#x2019;s good to be aware of how your parents handled money and the ways that has affected your behavior, but don&#x2019;t use it as an excuse to explain away your money foibles or, worse, to avoid teaching your kids about the subject. Approach money in a positive way&#x2014;you might need to fake it, at least at first&#x2014;instead of passing on that negativity.<br> <br>8 Keep the money fights behind closed doors&#x2014;and don&#x2019;t let your kids get caught in the middle. Researchers have found that college kids whose parents regularly fought about money when they were younger were nearly three times more likely to owe $500 or more on their credit cards than kids whose parents kept the financial peace. You and your spouse aren&#x2019;t always going to see eye to eye on family finances, but it&#x2019;s important to shield your children from your big money disagreements whenever possible. Try your best to present a united front to your children. It&#x2019;s perfectly fine to call a money &#x201c;time-out&#x201d; for parents only and tell your teenager, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not sure what we think about paying for you to go to that music festival with your friends, so we&#x2019;ll discuss it and get back to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>If you and your spouse or ex are often at odds over money, you will need to figure out in private how you are going to work out a compromise. One study found that children of divorced parents who are drawn into the details of child support and parental salaries, for instance, tend to equate financial support with love, and make one of their parents the bad guy. Telling your son he can&#x2019;t play in the local soccer league because your ex is late on child support and you can&#x2019;t afford the uniform fees yourself can mess him up about money. Even though parents who are no longer together might find it hard, speaking with &#x201c;one voice&#x201d; on financial matters is usually the best thing for your child. And when kids try to play the two of you&#x2014;divorced or not&#x2014;against each other, as they invariably do, resist the temptation to act the hero. Try your hardest to reach an agreement, and present the decision as coming from both of you.<br> <br>9 Don&#x2019;t expect your child to have money skills if all you&#x2019;ve given him is money. Daniel and Mindy were devoted parents. They checked over their three sons&#x2019; homework each night when the boys were in elementary school, excused them from basic chores in middle school so that they could do homework instead, and, before the kids went away to college, handed each a credit card to cover all bills. When their oldest son graduated, he moved back home and proceeded to binge-watch every HBO series since The Sopranos. One day, after he&#x2019;d asked his mom if she&#x2019;d mind throwing his T-shirt in the wash, Mindy snapped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done! You&#x2019;re a man, and you need to move out next month,&#x201d; she yelled. Though Mindy felt awful for losing her cool, Daniel reassured her it was just the &#x201c;tough love&#x201d; approach that their son needed.<br> <br>As a parent, you might sympathize with Mindy and Daniel, but here&#x2019;s the thing: They are just as much at fault as their son. Cutting a kid off financially after years of support without laying the groundwork is akin to abandoning him in a foreign country where he doesn&#x2019;t know the language, customs, or laws. With money, as with most other aspects of parenting, it&#x2019;s important to introduce expectations gradually rather than go from zero to sixty.<br> <br>10 Share the talking. Research shows that most of the time, kids ask their moms their financial questions. That said, I&#x2019;ve personally observed supersmart women who are extremely successful in the business world pull the old &#x201c;Ask your father&#x201d; routine when the subject of money comes up. It&#x2019;s possible they&#x2019;ve just had a long day or are preoccupied with thoughts of work or sick pets or the malfunctioning range hood, but when this deferral to Dad becomes a pattern, it sends the message that money is a man&#x2019;s turf. Um, I don&#x2019;t think so.<br> <br>No matter your family configuration&#x2014;mom and dad, single parent, two moms, two dads, or two parents plus two stepparents&#x2014;make it everyone&#x2019;s business to participate actively in the money talk with your kid. Avoid phrases such as &#x201c;Mom is better with money&#x201d; or &#x201c;Dad is the financial brain around here.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s completely fine to say, &#x201c;You know, I&#x2019;m not sure about that, but I&#x2019;ll get back to you.&#x201d; And then go find out the answer. Just make sure to actually follow up and relay it to your kid.<br> <br>11 Avoid creating a money gap. Though the &#x201c;math gap&#x201d; between boys and girls has been well documented, there&#x2019;s also a definite &#x201c;money gap.&#x201d; And parents are part of the problem. In numerous studies and surveys, kids say that Mom and Dad talk to boys more than they talk to girls about money&#x2014;particularly subjects like investing. The result? Boys express more confidence about money&#x2014;and parents think their sons understand the value of a dollar better than their daughters do. Given that your daughter will very likely be paddling upstream to keep pace with the boys financially anyway&#x2014;women still earn less than men and have less money socked away in retirement accounts&#x2014;they really need to hear the facts early and often. Bottom line: Boys and girls alike should know this stuff.<br> <br>12 Don&#x2019;t try to keep up with the Joneses (let alone the Kardashians), because you will teach your kids to do the same. It&#x2019;s natural to make comparisons with other people; it&#x2019;s just something we do. Living in a consumerist, instant-gratification, media-driven culture doesn&#x2019;t help. Nevertheless, fight the urge to compare your family&#x2019;s money choices with anyone else&#x2019;s. Sounds easy, but there are times we all feel that annoying tug to judge others or second-guess our decisions when sizing up our friends and neighbors. You might feel that saving for a family trip to Nepal trumps renovating your old kitchen&#x2014;you can live for another year with a retro countertop and chipped floor tiles. Your neighbors might prefer to splurge on a basement game room and travel no farther than the town pool. Hey, different strokes.<br> <br>Resist making assumptions or drawing conclusions about another family&#x2019;s spending habits or values&#x2014;especially within hearing range of your offspring. Not only are you setting a bad example, but also research shows that comparing various aspects of our finances with those of our friends makes us less happy overall. The ways that people choose to spend money are very personal. If you want to teach your kid to avoid the trap of keeping up with&#x2014;or looking down on&#x2014;their friends and neighbors, steer clear of that behavior yourself.<br> <br>13 Choose your moment&#x2014;and your place. Kids, especially teenagers, are hard to corral for anything&#x2014;especially lectures. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s important to weave the money lessons in this book into day-to-day life. Did your son get a check from Grandma? It&#x2019;s a great time to finally take him to the bank, open that savings account you&#x2019;ve been talking about, and help him deposit the money. That also leads to discussions of interest rates and choices between, say, certificates of deposit (CDs) and regular savings accounts. Are you about to buy a new family laptop? Have your kid help you shop around for it (and, if you can, allow him to keep a portion of the difference between the price at the local electronics store and any better deal he can find you on...</p><h2>One Green Apple</h2><p>Farah feels alone, even when surrounded by her classmates. She listens and nods but doesn&#x2019;t speak. It&#x2019;s hard being the new kid in school, especially when you&#x2019;re from another country and don&#x2019;t know the language. Then, on a field trip to an apple orchard, Farah discovers there are lots of things that sound the same as they did at home, from dogs crunching their food to the ripple of friendly laughter. As she helps the class make apple cider, Farah connects with the other students and begins to feel that she belongs.<br><br>Ted Lewin&#x2019;s gorgeous sun-drenched paintings and Eve Bunting&#x2019;s sensitive text immediately put the reader into another child&#x2019;s shoes in this timely story of a young Muslim immigrant.</p><p><p>Eve Bunting has written&nbsp;over two hundred&nbsp;books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Smoky Night,</i> illustrated by David Diaz, <i>The Wall</i>,<i> Fly Away Home</i>, and <i>Train to Somewhere</i>. She lives in Southern California.</p><br><br>Ted Lewin grew up in Buffalo, New York, with two brothers, one sister, two parents, a lion, an iguana, and a chimpanzee. He became interested in art as a young boy when he would draw his brothers' world of wrestling. Ted later worked as a professional wrestler to finance his studies at the Pratt Institute of Fine Arts, where he met his wife, Betsy Lewin, also a children's book writer and illustrator. He and his wife travel around the world to research the settings for their books. While working on SACRED RIVER, which he both wrote and illustrated, Ted joined thousands of Hindus on their pilgrimage to the banks of the Ganges River in Benares, India. Ted now lives and works in the brownstone he shares with his wife and their two cats in Brooklyn, New York. For more information visit www.tedlewin.com.*Starred Review* Gr. 1-3. This poignant, attractive offering fills a growing need for picture books about contemporary immigrants of Arab descent, without limiting its relevance to a single ethnic group. On her "second day in the new school in the new country," Farah, who cannot speak English, joins her class on a field trip to an apple orchard, where she enjoys the sunny day but feels desperately isolated, "tight inside [herself]." Though Farah wears a headscarf and knows that there are "difficulties" between her native and adoptive countries, specifics of religion and politics never distract from the child's experiences: the hay smelling of "dry sunshine," the spark of optimism kindled when classmates accept her help at the cider press. Young readers will respond as much to Bunting's fine first-person narrative as to Lewin's double-page, photorealistic watercolors, which, though occasionally stiff, plainly show the intelligence behind Farah's silent exterior. The old-fashioned assimilation metaphor Farah sees in the cider-making experience ("I will blend with the others the way my apple blended with the cider") needn't have been so overt, but with its large, read-aloud-friendly trim size and its age-appropriate premise, this book will work beautifully for teachers hoping to foster empathy for immigrant students, or for use in furthering character education aims. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But amid the bland teas, tasteless yogurts, and the spine stretcher the guests lovingly call &#x201c;The Rack,&#x201d; Bond stumbles onto the trail of a lethal man with ties to a new secret organization called SPECTRE. When SPECTRE hijacks two A-bombs, a frantic global search for the weapons ensues, and M&#x2019;s hunch that the plane containing the bombs will make a clean drop into the ocean sends Bond to the Bahamas to investigate. </p><p>On the island paradise, 007 finds a wealthy pleasure seeker&#x2019;s treasure hunt and meets Domino Vitali, the gorgeous mistress of Emilio Largo, otherwise known as SPECTRE&#x2019;s Number 1. But as powerful as Number 1 is, he works for someone else: Ernst Stavro Blofeld, a peculiar man with a deadly creative mind. </p><p>The ninth novel in Ian Fleming&#x2019;s James Bond series, <i>Thunderball</i> marks the beginnings of one of the most iconic villains in history, and the only match for the wits of James Bond.</p><p><b>The text in this edition has been restored by the Fleming family company Ian Fleming Publications, to reflect the work as it was originally published.</b></p><p><b>www.ianfleming.com </b></p></p><p>Ian Fleming was born in London on May 28, 1908. He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><p><b>1. 'TAKE IT EASY, MR BOND'</b></p> <p>It was one of those days when it seemed to James Bond that all life, as someone put it, was nothing but a heap of six to four against.</p> <p>To begin with he was ashamed of himself - a rare state of mind. He had a hangover, a bad one, with an aching head and stiff joints. When he coughed -smoking too much goes with drinking too much and doubles the hangover - a cloud of small luminous black spots swam across his vision like amoebae in pond water. The one drink too many signals itself unmistakably. His final whisky and soda in the luxurious flat in Park Lane had been no different from the ten preceding ones, but it had gone down reluctantly and had left a bitter taste and an ugly sensation of surfeit. And, although he had taken in the message, he had agreed to play just one more rubber. Five pounds a hundred as it's the last one? He had agreed. And he had played the rubber like a fool. Even now he could see the queen of spades, with that stupid Mona Lisa smile on her fat face, slapping triumphantly down on his knave - the queen, as his partner had so sharply reminded him, that had been so infallibly marked with South, and that had made the difference between a grand slam redoubled (drunkenly) for him, and four hundred points above the line for the opposition. In the end it had been a twenty-point rubber, �100 against him - important money. &#x2014; Again Bond dabbed with the bloodstained styptic pencil at the cut on his chin and despised the face that stared sullenly back at him from the mirror above the washbasin. Stupid, ignorant bastard! It all came from having nothing to do. More than a month of paper-work - ticking off his number on stupid dockets, scribbling minutes that got spikier as the weeks passed, and snap-ping back down the telephone when some harmless section officer tried to argue with him. And then his secretary had gone down with the flu and he had been given a silly, and, worse, ugly bitch from the pool who called him 'sir' and spoke to him primly through a mouth full of fruit stones. And now it was another Monday morning. Another week was beginning. The May rain thrashed at the windows. Bond swallowed down two Phensics and reached for the Enos. The telephone in his bedroom rang. It was the loud ring of the direct line with Headquarters.</p> <p>James Bond, his heart thumping faster than it should have done, despite the race across London and a fretful wait for the lift to the eighth floor, pulled out the chair and sat down and looked across into the calm, grey, damnably clear eyes he knew so well. What could he read in them?</p> <p>'Good morning, James. Sorry to pull you along a bit early in the morning. Got a very full day ahead. Wanted to fit you in before the rush.'</p> <p>Bond's excitement waned minutely. It was never a good sign when M addressed him by his Christian name instead of by his number. This didn't look like a job - more like something personal. There was none of the tension in M's voice that heralded big, exciting news. M's expression was interested, friendly, almost benign. Bond said something noncommittal.</p> <p>'Haven't seen much of you lately, James. How have you been? Your health, I mean.' M picked up a sheet of paper, a form of some kind, from his desk, and held it as if preparing to read.</p> <p>Suspiciously, trying to guess what the paper said, what all this was about, Bond said, 'I'm all right, sir.'</p> <p>M said mildly, 'That's not what the MO thinks, James. Just had your last Medical. I think you ought to hear what he has to say.'</p> <p>Bond looked angrily at the back of the paper. Now what the hell! He said with control, 'Just as you say, sir.'</p> <p>M gave Bond a careful, appraising glance. He held the paper closer to his eyes. '"This officer",' he read, '"remains basically physically sound. Unfortunately his mode of life is not such as is likely to allow him to remain in this happy state. Despite many previous warnings, he admits to smoking sixty cigarettes a day. These are of a Balkan mixture with a higher nicotine content than the cheaper varieties. When not engaged upon strenuous duty, the officer's average daily consumption of alcohol is in the region of half a bottle of spirits of between sixty and seventy proof. On examination, there continues to be little definite sign of deterioration. The tongue is furred. The blood pressure a little raised at 160/90. The liver is not palpable. On the other hand, when pressed, the officer admits to frequent occipital headaches and there is spasm in the trapezius muscles and so-called 'fibrositis' nodules can be felt. I believe these symptoms to be due to this officer's mode of life. He is not responsive to the suggestion that over-indulgence is no remedy for the tensions inherent in his professional calling and can only result in the creation of a toxic state which could finally have the effect of reducing his fitness as an officer. I recommend that No 007 should take it easy for two to three weeks on a more abstemious regime, when I believe he would make a complete return to his previous exceptionally high state of physical fitness.'"</p> <p>M reached over and slid the report into his OUT tray. He put his hands flat down on the desk in front of him and looked sternly across at Bond. He said, 'Not very satisfactory is it, James?'</p> <p>Bond tried to keep impatience out of his voice. He said, 'I'm perfectly fit, sir. Everyone has occasional headaches. Most weekend golfers have fibrositis. You get it from sweating and then sitting in a draught. Aspirin and embrocation get rid of them. Nothing to it really, sir.'</p> <p>M said severely, 'That's just where you're making a big mistake, James. Taking medicine only suppresses these symptoms of yours. Medicine doesn't get to the root of the trouble. It only conceals it. The result is a more highly poisoned condition, which may become chronic disease. All drugs are harmful to the system. They are contrary to nature. The same applies to most of the food we eat - white bread with all the roughage removed, refined sugar with all the goodness machined out of it, pasteurised milk which has had most of the vitamins boiled away, everything overcooked and denaturized. Why,' M reached into his pocket for his notebook and consulted it, 'do you know what our bread contains apart from a bit of over-ground flour?' M looked accusingly at Bond, 'It contains large quantities of chalk, also benzol peroxide powder, chlorine gas, sal ammoniac, and alum.' M put the notebook back in his pocket. 'What do you think of that?'</p> <p>Bond, mystified by all this, said defensively, 'I don't eat all that much bread, sir.'</p> <p>'Maybe not,' said M impatiently. 'But how much stone-ground whole wheat do you eat? How much yoghurt? Uncooked vegetables, nuts, fresh fruit?'</p> <p>Bond smiled. 'Practically none at all, sir.'</p> <p>'It's no laughing matter.' M tapped his forefinger on the desk for emphasis. 'Mark my words. There is no way to health except the natural way. All your troubles' - Bond opened his mouth to protest, but M held up his hand - 'the deep-seated toxaemia revealed by your Medical, are the result of a basically unnatural way of life. Ever heard of Bircher-Brenner, for instance? Or Kneipp, Preissnitz, Rikli, Schroth, Gossmann, Bilz?'</p> <p>'No, sir.'</p> <p>'Just so. Well those are the men you would be wise to study. Those are the great naturopaths - the men whose teaching we have foolishly ignored. Fortunately,' M's eyes gleamed enthusiastically, 'there are a number of disciples of these men practising in England. Nature cure is not beyond our reach.'</p> <p>James Bond looked curiously at M. What the hell had got into the old man? Was all this the first sign of senile decay? But M looked fitter than Bond had ever seen him. The cold grey eyes were clear as crystal and the skin of the hard, lined face was luminous with health. Even the iron-grey hair seemed to have new life. Then what was all this lunacy?</p> <p>M reached for his IN tray and placed it in front of him in a preliminary gesture of dismissal. He said cheerfully, 'Well, that's all, James. Miss Moneypenny has made the reservation. Two weeks will be quite enough to put you right. You won't know yourself when you come out. New man.'</p> <p>Bond looked across at M, aghast. He said in a strangled voice, 'Out of where, sir?' 'Place called "Shrublands". Run by quite a famous man in his line - Wain, Joshua Wain. Remarkable chap. Sixty-five. Doesn't look a day over forty. He'll take good care of you. Very up-to-date equipment, and he's even got his own herb garden. Nice stretch of country. Near Washington in Sussex. And don't worry about your work here. Put it right out of your mind for a couple of weeks. I'll tell 009 to take care of the Section.'</p> <p>Bond couldn't believe his ears. He said, 'But, sir. I mean, I'm perfectly all right. Are you sure? I mean, is this really necessary?'</p> <p>'No,' M smiled frostily. 'Not necessary. Essential. If you want to stay in the double-0 Section, that is. I can't afford to have an officer in that section who isn't one hundred per cent fit.' M lowered his eyes to the basket in front of him and took out a signal file. 'That's all, 007.' He didn't look up. The tone of voice was final.</p> <p>Bond got to his feet. He said nothing. He walked across the room and let himself out, closing the door with exaggerated softness.</p> <p>Outside the door, Miss Moneypenny looked sweetly up at him.</p> <p>Bond walked over to her desk and banged his fist down so that the typewriter jumped. He said furiously, 'Now what the hell. Penny? Has the old man gone off his rocker? What's all this bloody nonsense? I'm damned if I'm going. He's absolutely nuts.'</p> <p>Miss Moneypenny smiled happily. 'The manager's been terribly helpful and kind. He says he can give you the Myrtle room, in the Annex. He says it's a lovely room. It looks right over the herb garden. They've got their own herb garden, you know.'</p> <p>'I know all about their bloody herb garden. Now look here, Penny,' Bond pleaded with her, 'be a good girl and tell me what it's all a...</p></p><h2>The Port Chicago 50: Disaster, Mutiny, and the Fight for Civil Rights</h2><p><p><b>An astonishing civil rights story from Newbery Honor winner and multiple-time National Book Award finalist Steve Sheinkin. </b><br><b></b><br>On July 17, 1944, a massive explosion rocked the segregated Navy base at Port Chicago, California, killing more than 300 sailors who were at the docks, critically injuring off-duty men in their bunks, and shattering windows up to a mile away. On August 9th, 244 men refused to go back to work until unsafe and unfair conditions at the docks were addressed. When the dust settled, fifty were charged with mutiny, facing decades in jail and even execution. </p><p><i>The Port Chicago 50</i> is a fascinating story of the prejudice and injustice that faced black men and women in America's armed forces during World War II, and a nuanced look at those who gave their lives in service of a country where they lacked the most basic rights.</p><p>This thoroughly-researched and documented book can be worked into multiple aspects of the common core curriculum, including history and social studies.</p><p>Steve Sheinkin is the acclaimed author of many nonfiction works, including <i>The Notorious Benedict Arnold: A True Story of Adventure, Heroism &amp; Treachery</i>, Newbery Honor Book and National Book Award Finalist <i>Bomb: The Race to Build--and Steal--the World's Most Dangerous Weapon</i>, and National Book Award finalist <i>Most Dangerous: Daniel Ellsberg and the Secret History of the Vietnam War.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sheinkin delivers another meticulously researched WWII story, one he discovered while working on his Newbery Honor book, <i>Bomb</i>. . . .

He lives in Saratoga Springs, New York, with his wife and two children.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;In a fluid, methodical style, Dominic Hoffman reads this powerful book, which tells the story of brave men who fought the entrenched system of segregation found within the U.S. military during World War II. Sheinkin (Bomb) explains that while African American men had filled the ranks of the armed forces since the beginning of the nation, their advancement and status were limited. In this epic tale, African American sailors at Port Chicago naval base in California were assigned the dangerous task of loading explosives onto cargo ships. The men had had no training and were subjected to brutal work schedules under prejudiced commanders. In July 1944, munitions exploded, killing more than 300 people, most of whom were African American. Afterwards, a group of men, known as the Port Chicago 50, refused to continue the dangerous work. They were charged with mutiny and brought to trial, found guilty, and sentenced to hard labor. The riveting text draws upon court documents and testimony, allowing listeners to hear the words of the accused as well as the lawyers. The case drew the attention of NAACP lawyer Thurgood Marshall and officials within the Roosevelt administration who recognized that the real issue was segregation within the military. The brave men known as the Port Chicago 50 were pioneers in what would become the Civil Rights Movement; they led the way for other men who loved their country and wanted equal rights. This is a stupendous account sure to intrigue anyone interested in history or civil rights.&#x2014;Patricia Ann Owens, formerly with Illinois Eastern Community Colleges, Mt.

From the Learning to Get Along series, these colorful books encourage children to learn social skills. In <i>Listen</i> an African American boy explains what listening means: keeping quiet, watching the person who talks, thinking about what is being said, and asking questions when he doesn't understand. He also talks about using those skills in the classroom and at home. Similarly, in <i>Share</i> a red-haired girl learns techniques for sharing, then shows how she shares and takes turns when playing at home with her sister and friends. Each book ends with the child feeling good about using his or her new skills. The bright line-and-wash illustrations feature multiracial groups of children engaged in familiar activities. The writing is purposeful, but it is also practical in approach and sensitive to the problems and feelings of young children. A good choice for teachers seeking books that reinforce familiar classroom messages. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Stanley's second best-seller <i>The Millionaire Mind</i> spent over four months on the New York Times best-seller list, rising to position #2, and has sold over half a million copies. Here is the first paperback edition of Stanley's second groundbreaking study of America's wealthy.<br><br><i>The Millionaire Mind</i> targets a population of millionaires who have accumulated substantial wealth and live in ways that openly demonstrate their affluence. Exploring the ideas, beliefs, and behaviors that enabled these millionaires to build and maintain their fortunes, Dr. Stanley provides a fascinating look at who America's financial elite are and how they got there.<br><br> <br>*What were their school days like?<br> <br>*How did they respond to negative criticism?<br> <br>*What are the characteristics of the millionaire's spouse?<br> <br>*Is religion an important part of their lives?<br><br>The author uncovers the surprising answers to these and similar questions, showing readers through concrete examples just what it is that makes the wealthy prosper when others would turn away dejected or beaten.<br><br><i>The Millionaire Mind</i> promises to be as transformational as Dr. Stanley's previous best-seller. This book answers universal questions with solid statistical evidence in an approachable, and anecdotal style. The number of copies sold of this soon-to-be-classic will surely be in the millions.</p><p>What do you do after you've written the No.&nbsp;1 bestseller <i>The Millionaire Next Door</i>? Survey 1,371 more millionaires and write <i>The Millionaire Mind</i>. Dr. Stanley's extremely timely tome is a mixture of entertaining elements. It resembles Regis Philbin's hit show (and CD-ROM game) <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</i>, only you have to pose real-life questions, instead of quizzing about trivia. Are you a gambling, divorce-prone, conspicuously consuming "Income-Statement Affluent" Jacuzzi fool soon to be parted from his or her money, or a frugal, loyal, resole your shoes and buy your own groceries type like one of Stanley's "Balance-Sheet Affluent" millionaires? "Cheap dates," millionaires are 4.9 times likelier to play with their grandkids than shop at Brooks Brothers. "If you asked the average American what it takes to be a millionaire," he writes, "they'd probably cite a number of predictable factors: inheritance, luck, stock market investments.... Topping his list would be a high IQ, high SAT scores and gradepoint average, along with attendance at a top college." No way, says Stanley, backing it up with data he compiled with help from the University of Georgia and Harvard geodemographer Jon Robbin. Robbin may wish he'd majored in socializing at L.S.U., instead, because the numbers show the average millionaire had a lowly 2.92 GPA, SAT scores between 1100 and 1190, and teachers who told them they were mediocre students but personable people. "Discipline 101 and Tenacity 102" made them rich. Stanley got straight C's in English and writing, but he had money-minded drive. He urges you to pattern your life according to Yale professor Robert Sternberg's <i>Successful Intelligence</i>, because Stanley's statistics bear out Sternberg's theories on what makes minds succeed--and it ain't IQ.<p> Besides offering insights into millionaires' pinchpenny ways, pleasing quips ("big brain, no bucks"), and 46 statistical charts with catchy titles, Stanley's book booms with human-potential pep talk and bristles with anecdotes--for example, about a bus driver who made $3 million, a doctor (reporting that his training gave him zero people skills) who lost $1.5 million, and a loser scholar in the bottom 10 percent on six GRE tests who grew up to be Martin Luther King Jr. Read it and you'll feel like a million bucks. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Building on his research from the best-selling "The Millionaire Next Door," Dr. Thomas J. Stanley delves further into the psyche of the American millionaire with a groundbreaking new study, "The Millionaire Mind." In an easy-to-understand and often anecdotal style, "The Millionaire Mind" tells the stories of how people--a bus driver, a second-quality-textile entrepreneur, a Fortune 500 CEO--adopted the millionaire mindset to become financially independent. <p>Dr. Stanley takes a close look at the top one percent of households in America and tells us what makes them tick. His findings on how American millionaires attained financial success are based on in-depth surveys and interviews with more than 1,300 millionaires. Inside "The Millionaire Mind," millionaires share their experiences, thoughts, and beliefs on the following topics: </p><p>--Memories from their school days --Personal thoughts on being "the smart kid in the dumb row" --Finding the courage to make difficult financial decisions --How they select a vocation --Driving factors behind their success --Tips for running economically productive households --What they look for when purchasing a home --Where they spend their money and free time </p><p>While we tend to think of millionaires in terms of luxury and expense--i.e. Brooks Brothers, Jaguar, or month long jaunts to Paris and Rome--millionaires admit they are more likely to spend their money at J.C. Penney or Wal-Mart and enjoy their free time with family and friends, or raising money for charity. Dr. Stanley places fact ahead of fiction and reveals the traits, qualities, and characteristics inside "The Millionaire Mind."</p></p><h2>A Short History of Financial Euphoria</h2><p>The world-renowned economist offers "dourly irreverent analyses of financial debacle from the tulip craze of the seventeenth century to the recent plague of junk bonds."&#x2014;<i>The Atlantic</i>.</p><p>John Kenneth Galbraith was born in 1908 in Ontario, Canada. He earned a PhD at the University of California in 1934 and later took a fellowship at Cambridge, where he first encountered Keynesian economics. At different points in his life he taught at both Harvard and Princeton, and wrote more than forty books on an array of economic topics. During World War II he served as deputy head of the Office of Price Administration, charged with preventing inflation from crippling the war efforts, and also served as the US Ambassador to India during the Kennedy administration. He passed away in 2006.No matter what your political leanings or economic beliefs might be, there is no denying that Galbraith is a brilliant writer. In this humorous and thoughtful book, he traces the investor "herd" mentality from Tulipomania, which gripped Holland in the 1630s, through a variety of events and up through the 1987 stock market debacle--which he accurately predicted. Galbraith analyzes the crashes that resulted from these speculative episodes, and he points out that the "mass escape from sanity by people in pursuit of profit," which, in his opinion, is always the cause, is never blamed. A truly excellent book, this is highly recommended.<br><i>- C. Christopher Pavek, Putnam, Hayes &amp; Bartlett, Inc.

Soon Jacques is caught up in the hurly-burly action of his mother's caf�, where he proves a natural. He endures a literal trial by fire and works his way up the ladder in the feudal system of France&#x2019;s most famous restaurant, finally becoming Charles de Gaulle&#x2019;s personal chef, watching the world being refashioned from the other side of the kitchen door.<br><br> When he comes to America, Jacques immediately falls in with a small group of as-yet-unknown food lovers, including Craig Claiborne, James Beard, and Julia Child, whose adventures redefine American food. Through it all, Jacques proves himself to be a master of the American art of reinvention: earning a graduate degree from Columbia University, turning down a job as John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s chef to work at Howard Johnson&#x2019;s, and, after a near-fatal car accident, switching careers once again to become a charismatic leader in the revolution that changed the way Americans approached food. Included as well are forty all-time favorite recipes created during the course of a career spanning nearly half a century, from his mother&#x2019;s utterly simple cheese souffl� to his wife&#x2019;s pork ribs and red beans.<br><br><i>The Apprentice</i> is the poignant and sometimes funny tale of a boy&#x2019;s coming of age. Beyond that, it is the story of America&#x2019;s culinary awakening and the transformation of food from an afterthought to a national preoccupation.</p><p>The sparkling personality, sense of humor, and charm familiar to Jacques P�pin's television audiences carries over to the page in the superstar chef's humbly titled memoir, <i>The Apprentice</i>. <p> A clever, mischievous, and very likable boy, P�pin's earliest food memories are hungry ones from his childhood in war-torn France. After World War II, his first restaurant job was peeling potatoes for his mother at her restaurant, and he became an apprentice in a hotel kitchen at age 13. In this delightful tale he works hard, plays fair, is kind to others and good to his family, and his efforts take him to Paris, and then New York. Except for the terrible car accident that required him to reinvent himself as a teacher and television personality, he seems to have always been in the right place at the right time. He cooked for Prime Minister Gaillard and then General Charles de Gaulle, met Pierre Franey, Craig Claiborne, and Julia Child, and turned down a job cooking for JFK to accept one with Howard Johnson. But just as entertaining and enjoyable to read about are his tender memories and thoughts about his relationships with his parents and brothers, and with his wife and daughter.</p><p> We all wish we could cook like Pepin (and every chapter ends with one of P�pin's favorite recipes), but this enchanting tale will make you wish you knew him. The clear, simple way he expresses himself and the honesty with which he tells his story will bring you to tears, and make you laugh out loud. <i>--Leora Y.

The vast majority of hypothyroid cases are being treated inappropriately or misdiagnosed by the standard health care model. Through exhaustive research and clinical experience, Dr. Kharrazian has discovered what really causes hypothyroidism and how to manage it.</p><p>According to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, more than 27 million Americans suffer from thyroid dysfunction, half of which go undiagnosed. Of the detected cases of hypothyroidism, more than half are due to an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks and destroys thyroid gland tissue. All too frequently, the question of why the thyroid gland quit working never comes up. While prescription thyroid hormones might bring thyroid levels in the blood into a normal range, they don&#39;t address what caused the thyroid to falter in the first place. When doctors treat Hashimoto&#39;s, an immune disorder, with thyroid hormone medication, symptoms persist because the underlying problem -- the gradual destruction of the thyroid gland -- goes unchecked.Do you take thyroid hormones, yet still suffer from fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, depression, or other hypothyroid symptoms? Are your symptoms steadily worsening while your blood tests stay the same? Do your symptoms go untreated because your lab tests are normal? <p>If so, join the millions of Americans who, despite normal test results, suffer low thyroid symptoms because they are misdiagnosed or poorly managed. As you'll learn, treating the thyroid is often ineffective, and can even make you worse. Find the real culprit, and why it doesn't show up on your blood test. </p><p>Why Do I Still Have Thyroid Symptoms When My Lab Tests Are Normal? will show you why taking thyroid hormones, and even some thyroid supplements, may not help and can even make your symptoms worse. You'll learn the true cause of most cases of hypothyroidism in this country, and what to do about it. You'll also learn the six patterns of low thyroid function, only one of which may be helped by thyroid hormones, if even then. </p><p>Don't waste another day feeling lousy because you're trapped in outdated standards of health care.

They were iconic pioneers who mixed grunge and metal in ways that continue to influence today's artists, and theirs is a story of hard work, self-destruction, rising from the ashes, and carrying on a lasting legacy. </p><p>Four years after their first meeting at a warehouse under Seattle's Ballard Bridge, Alice in Chains became the first of grunge's big four - ahead of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden - to get a gold record and achieve national recognition. With the charismatic Layne Staley behind the microphone, they became one of the most influential and successful bands to come out of the Seattle music scene. But as the band got bigger, so did their problems. </p><p>Acclaimed journalist David de Sola delves beneath the secrecy, gossip, and rumor surrounding the band to tell their full story for the first time. Based on a wealth of interviews with people who have direct knowledge of the band, many speaking on the record for the very first time, de Sola explores how drugs nearly destroyed them and claimed the lives of Staley and founding bassist Mike Starr, follows Jerry Cantrell's solo career and Mike Starr's life after being fired from the band, and chronicles the band's resurrection with new lead singer William DuVall.</p><p>From their anonymous struggles to topping the charts with hits like "Would?," "Man in the Box," and "Rooster," <i>Alice in Chains</i> reveals the members of the band not as caricatures of rock stars but as brilliant, nuanced, and flawed human beings whose years of hard work led to the seemingly overnight success that changed the music scene forever.</p></p><p>DAVID DE SOLA is a journalist with experience working at CNN, 60 Minutes, and Reuters whose work has also been published in <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>The Huffington Post</i> and other print and online publications.

Both Ted and Amy have been in these offices for three years. The two share a common wall; and they frequently overhear telephone conversations the other is having while negotiating with a client or coworker.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ted and Amy go to all the same product release and sales meetings. They see each other in the elevator and break room; and sometimes they casually chat about upcoming holidays, how Ted&#x2019;s children are doing in school, or the general state of the national and international economies.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ted likes Amy and feels that she&#x2019;s doing a good job as district sales manager. The strange thing here is that Ted has, for the entire three years he&#x2019;s been Amy&#x2019;s boss, communicated with her for work assignments, updates, progress reports, general information, and even for her performance reviews, entirely by email. He has not conducted a single face-to-face encounter to discuss how she is performing in her role as district sales manager. In short, Ted is clueless about his role as supervisor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Clearly, Ted either feels entirely unqualified to conduct a face-to-face meeting, or he suffers from a fear of confrontation&#x2014;or both. He seems to feel that doing an in-person performance review, or directly discussing other situations with Amy, offers the possibility that an unpleasant confrontation could occur. She could disagree with his assessment. She could challenge him. So Ted avoids such encounters.<br> While Ted is meeting his own personal goal of avoiding a possible confrontation, he is not meeting his responsibility as a supervisor/manager. Privately, he admits that he was unprepared for this role, and it&#x2019;s one he&#x2019;s not comfortable in. Avoiding a face-to-face meeting with Amy is his way of trying to dodge this part of his job.<br> &nbsp;<br> But he is doing Amy, and their company, a severe disservice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The result of Ted&#x2019;s failure to have a face-to-face review is that Amy doesn&#x2019;t feel she has any real connection to Ted, nor does she feel a sense that they are teammates working together to achieve common corporate goals. In fact, the absence of this vital part of the review process has meant that Amy hasn&#x2019;t gotten the feedback she needs to perform at her full potential, nor has she gotten vital input that would help her set her future career goals. She doesn&#x2019;t know how she&#x2019;s performing in her sales manager role within the organization as a whole. <br> &nbsp;<br> Hopefully, Ted will buy a copy of this book. And when he follows the simple steps in these pages, he will be able to easily overcome his fear of conducting meetings with Amy. This book will give him the tools&#x2014;the exact power words&#x2014;to do his job of manager efficiently and expertly. <br> &nbsp;<br> It will help Amy, too. Following the simple steps in this book will mean that Ted, Amy, and their organization will all perform at a much higher level.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Red Truck Bakery Cookbook: Gold-Standard Recipes from America&#39;s Favorite Rural Bakery</h2><p>A charming bakery cookbook with 85 southern baking recipes for favorites like cookies, cakes, pies, and more to make every day delicious&#x2014;from breakfast to dessert.<br><br> Nestled on Main Street among the apple orchards and rolling hills of rural Virginia, Red Truck Bakery is beloved for its small town feel and standout baked goods. <i>Red Truck Bakery Cookbook</i> is your one-way ticket to making these crowd-pleasing confections at home.

Wall paintings dating from the Neolithic period found at the Tassili n'Ajjer plateau in Algeria depict the use of mushrooms in shamanistic rituals. Mayan and Aztec civilizations used psilocybin mushrooms for purposes of religion, divination, and healing in pre-Columbian times, and their descendants continue to do so today. In his book Food of the Gods, Terence McKenna proposed that psychedelic mushrooms may have even played a role in human evolution by stimulating brain activity and acting as a catalyst for the development of language, arts, and religious impulses. It seems that psilocybin mushrooms have influenced and shaped our perceptions from the earliest stages of human history. <br><br>In modern times, psilocybin mushrooms continue to be a potent tool for understanding ourselves and the world around us. At this time in history, technological innovation is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Advances in computing, information technology, medical science and nanotechnology over the coming decades will drastically change the way we live. It has been theorized that a point of "technological singularity" is approaching, when artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence. Faced with such momentous, paradigm-shifting events, mankind will be forced to consider its place and purpose in the universe more deeply than ever before. Psychedelics and the unique awareness they engender are indispensable as far as how they are able to aid in this analysis. Psilocybin mushrooms are one of our most ancient tools in this regard, and they have the potential to aid us further in realizing our fullest cognitive, spiritual, and physical potentials. <br><br>In this context--and for the purpose of disseminating essential information--this book presents a methodology for inexpensive, effective, bulk cultivation of the psilocybin mushroom Psilocybe cubensis. Probably the most well-known psychedelic mushroom in the world, P. cubensis can be found growing in natural settings in North and South America, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia and has been cultivated in home settings since the publication of growing techniques in the 1970s. The book Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide by O.T. Oss and O.N. Oeric was one of the first books to describe accessible and affordable cultivation methods for P. cubensis. More recent publications like The Mushroom Cultivator and Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms by mycologist Paul Stamets have become essential references for hobbyists and professional mycologists alike. <br><br>Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide Simple Steps to Bulk Cultivation outlines every step in the simplest bulk-cultivation process. Information is presented in a logical progression with step-by-step guides, along with accompanying essential theory. Hundreds of images and diagrams throughout the book clarify instructions and show the stunning results that are possible. In addition to providing basic information for the beginner, the book also covers advanced cultivation methods and construction of advanced equipment, thus allowing rapid progression beyond the basic method of growing from a spore print. <br><br>Principium Quaesitor <br>The Psychonautical SocietyPsilocybin mushrooms have been shaping our perceptions from the earliest stages of human history.

They streak down my towel, puddle on the sofa cushion. My heart pounds so hard I can feel it in my ears.</p><p>&#x201c;Sweetheart. Listen.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom says Ingrid&#x2019;s name and I start to hum, not the melody to a song, just one drawn-out note. I know it makes me seem crazy, I know it won&#x2019;t make anything change, but it&#x2019;s better than crying, it&#x2019;s better than screaming, it&#x2019;s better than listening to what they&#x2019;re telling me.</p><p>Something is smashing my chest&#x2014;an anchor, gravity. Soon I&#x2019;ll cave in on myself. I stumble upstairs and yank on the jeans and tank top I wore yesterday. Then I&#x2019;m out the door, up the street, around the corner to the bus stop. Dad calls my name but I don&#x2019;t shout back. Instead, I step onto the bus just as its doors are shutting. I find a seat in the back and ride away, through Los Cerros and through the next town, until I&#x2019;m on an unfamiliar street, and that&#x2019;s where I get off. I sit on the bench at the bus stop, try to slow my breathing. The light here is different, bluer. A smiling mom with a baby in a stroller glides past me. A tree branch moves in the breeze. I try to be as light as air.</p><p>But my hands are wild, they need to move, so I pick at a piece of the bench where the wood is splintering. I break a short nail on my right hand even shorter, but I manage to pull off a small piece of wood. I drop it into my cupped palm and pry off another.</p><p>All last night, I listened to a recording of my voice reciting biology facts on repeat. It plays back in my head now, a sound track for catastrophe, and drowns everything out. <i>If a brown-eyed man and a brown-eyed woman have a child, the child will probably have brown eyes. But if both the father and the mother have a gene for blue eyes, it&#x2019;s possible that their child could have blue eyes.</i></p><p>An old guy in a snowflake cardigan sits next to me. My hand is now half full of wooden strips. I feel him watching but I can&#x2019;t stop. I want to say, <i>What are you staring at? It&#x2019;s hot, it&#x2019;s June, and you&#x2019;re wearing a Christmas sweater</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you need help, darling?&#x201d; the old guy asks. His mustache is wispy and white.</p><p>Without looking from the bench, I shake my head. <i>No</i>.</p><p>He takes a cell phone from his pocket. &#x201c;Would you like to use my phone?&#x201d;</p><p>My heart beats off rhythm and it makes me cough.</p><p>&#x201c;May I call your mother?&#x201d;</p><p><i>Ingrid has blond hair. She has blue eyes, which means that even though her father&#x2019;s eyes are brown, he must have a recessive blue-eye gene.</i></p><p>A bus nears. The old guy stands, wavers.</p><p>&#x201c;Darling,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>He lifts his hand as if he&#x2019;s going to pat my shoulder, but changes his mind.</p><p>My left hand is all the way full of wood now, and it&#x2019;s starting to spill over. I am not a darling. I am a girl ready to explode into nothing.</p><p>The old guy backs away, boards the bus, vanishes from sight.</p><p>The cars pass in front of me. One blur of color after another. Sometimes they stop at the light or for someone to cross the street, but they always go away eventually. I think I&#x2019;ll live here, stay like this forever, pick away at the bench until it&#x2019;s a pile of splinters on the sidewalk. Forget what it feels like to care about anyone.</p><p>A bus rolls up but I wave it past. A few minutes later, two little girls peer at me from the backseat of a blue car&#x2014;one is blond and fair; one is brunette, darker. Colored barrettes decorate their hair. It isn&#x2019;t impossible that they&#x2019;re sisters, but it&#x2019;s unlikely. Their heads tilt to see me better. They stare hard. When the light changes to green, they reach their small hands out the rolled-down window and wave so hard and fast that it looks like birds have bloomed from their wrists.</p><p>Sometime later, my dad pulls up. He leans to the passenger side and pushes the door open. The smell of leather. Thin, cold, air-conditioned air. I climb in. Let him take me home.</p><p>2</p><p>I sleep through the next day. Each time I go to the bathroom, I try not to look in the mirror. Once, I catch my reflection: it looks like I&#x2019;ve been punched in both eyes.</p><p>3</p><p>I can&#x2019;t talk about the day that follows that.</p><p>4</p><p>We wind up Highway 1 at a crawl because Dad is a cautious driver and he&#x2019;s terrified of heights. Below us to one side are rocks and ocean; to the other, dense trees and signs welcoming us to towns with populations of eighty-four. Mom has brought her entire classical CD collection, and now we&#x2019;re on Beethoven. It&#x2019;s &#x201c;F�r Elise,&#x201d; which she always plays on her piano. Fingers dance softly across her lap.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>On the outskirts of a small town, we pull off the road to eat lunch. We sit on an old quilt. Mom and Dad look at me and I look at the worn fabric, the hand-sewn stitches.</p><p>&#x201c;There are things you should know,&#x201d; Mom says.</p><p>I listen for the cars passing by, and the waves, and the crinkling of paper sandwich wrappers. Still, some of their words make it through: <i>clinically depressed; medication; since she was nine years old</i>. The ocean is far below us, but the waves crash so loudly, sound close enough to drown us.</p><p>&#x201c;Caitlin?&#x201d; Dad says.</p><p>Mom touches my knee. &#x201c;Sweetheart?&#x201d; she asks. &#x201c;Are you listening?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>At night, we stay in a cabin with bunk beds and walls made of tree trunks split open. I brush my teeth with my back to the mirror, climb up the ladder to the top bunk, and pretend to fall asleep. My parents creak through the cabin, turning on and off the faucet, flushing the toilet, unzipping their duffel bags. I pull my legs to my chest, try to inhabit as little space as possible.</p><p>The room goes dark.</p><p>I open my eyes to the tree-trunk wall. Once I learned that trees grow from the inside out. A circle of wood for each year. I count them with my fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;This will be good for her,&#x201d; Dad says softly.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At least it will get her away from home. It&#x2019;s quiet here.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom whispers, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s hardly spoken for days.&#x201d;</p><p>I hold still and stop counting. I wait to hear more, but minutes pass, and then the whistle of Dad&#x2019;s snore begins, followed by Mom&#x2019;s even breaths.</p><p>My hands lose track of the years. It&#x2019;s too dark to start over.</p><p>At three or four in the morning, I jolt awake. I fix my eyes to constellations that have been painted on the ceiling. I try not to blink for too long because when I do I see Ingrid&#x2019;s face, eyes shut and lips still. I mouth biology facts to keep my head clear. <i>There are two stages of meiosis and then four daughter cells are produced,</i> I whisper almost silently, careful not to wake my parents up. <i>Each of the daughter cells has half the chromosomes of the parent cells</i>. Outside, a car passes. Light sweeps over the ceiling, across the stars. I repeat the facts until all the words cram together.</p><p><i>Twostagesofmeiosisandthenfourdaughtercellsareproducedeachdaughtercellhashalf thechromosomesof theparentcellstwostagesofmeiosis</i> . . <i>.</i></p><p>Pretty soon I start to smile. It sounds funnier and funnier each time I say it. And then I have to grab my pillow and bury my face so my parents don&#x2019;t wake to the sound of me laughing myself to sleep.</p><p>5</p><p>On a hot morning in July, Dad rents a car because he has to go back to work. But Mom and I stay in Northern California like it&#x2019;s the only place we&#x2019;ve heard of. I sit in front and navigate, keeping us within the invisible boundaries on the map&#x2014;no farther north than a few miles into Oregon, no farther south than Chico. We spend the summer wandering through caves and forests, surviving crooked roads, and eating grilled-cheese sandwiches at roadside restaurants. We only talk about the things right in front of us&#x2014;the redwoods, the waitresses, the strength of our iced teas. One night, we discover a tiny old movie theater in the middle of nowhere. We see a children&#x2019;s movie because it&#x2019;s the only thing playing, and pay more attention to the kids laughing and yelling than we do to the screen. Twice, we strap flashlights to our heads and grope through lava caves in Lassen National Park. Mom trips and shrieks. Her voice echoes forever. I start dreaming about the cardigan man. In the middle of the forest, he drifts toward me in a tux with a red bow tie. <i>Darling,</i> he says, and holds out his phone. I know Ingrid&#x2019;s on the other end, waiting for me to talk to her. As I reach for it, I notice&#x2014;surrounding me are green trees, brown earth, but I am in black-and-white.</p><p>In the mornings, Mom lets me drink coffee and says, &#x201c;Honey, you&#x2019;re pale.&#x201d;</p><p>6</p><p>And then, out of nowhere, September comes.</p><p>We have to go back.</p><p><b>fall</b></p><p>1</p><p>It is 3 A.M.

Each chapter introduces a new bad actor in the history of warfare, details his conquests, and features weapons and fortifications to defend against him and his minions. Clear step-by-step instructions, diagrams, and photographs show how to build a dozen projects, including &#x201c;Da Vinci&#x2019;s Catapult,&#x201d; &#x201c;Carpini&#x2019;s Crossbow,&#x201d; a &#x201c;Crusader-Proof Moat,&#x201d; &#x201c;Alexander&#x2019;s Tortoise,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Cheval-de-frise.&#x201d; With a strong emphasis on safety, the book also gives tips on troubleshooting, explains the physics behind many of the projects, and shows where to buy the materials. By the time they&#x2019;ve reached the last page, at-home defenders everywhere will have succeeded in creating a fully fortified home.</p></p><p><p><b>William Gurstelle</b> is the author of <i>Backyard Ballistics</i>; <i>The Art of the Catapult</i>; <i>Absinthe &amp; Flamethrowers</i>; <i>Building Bots</i>; <i>Notes from the Technology Underground</i>; and <i>Whoosh, Boom, Splat</i>.

Rachel Carson's ability to combine scientific insight with poetic prose catapulted her book to the top of <em>The New York Times</em> best-seller list, where it remained for more than a year and a half. Ultimately it sold well over a million copies, was translated into 28 languages, inspired an Academy Award-winning documentary, and won both the National Book Award and the John Burroughs Medal. <br><br><em>The Sea Around Us</em> remains as fresh today as when it first appeared over six decades ago. Carson's genius for evoking the power and primacy of the world's bodies of water, combining the cosmic and the intimate, remains almost unmatched: the newly formed Earth cooling beneath an endlessly overcast sky; the centuries of nonstop rain that created the oceans; giant squids battling sperm whales hundreds of fathoms below the surface; the power of the tides moving 100 billion tons of water daily in one bay alone; the seismic waves known as tsunamis that periodically remind us of the oceans' overwhelmingly destructive power. The seas sustain human life and imperil it. Today, with the oceans endangered by the dumping of medical waste and ecological disasters such as the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, the gradual death of the Great Barrier Reef, and the melting of the polar ice caps, Carson's book provides a timely reminder of both the fragility and the centrality of the ocean and the life that abounds within it. Anyone who loves the sea, or who is concerned about our natural environment, will want to read, or re-read, this classic work.<br></p><p><br>The late <strong>Rachel Carson </strong>was for many years a marine biologist and then editor-in-chief of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. She was also the author of <em>Silent Spring</em>, <em>Under the Sea-Wind</em>, and<em> At the Edge of the Sea</em>.<br><br><strong>Sylvia Earle</strong> is a marine biologist, oceanographer, and National Geographic Society Explorer in Residence.

Written by the founder of RO DBT, Thomas Lynch, this is the first and only session-by-session training manual to help you implement this evidence-based therapy in your practice.</p><p>As a clinician, you&#x2019;re familiar with dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) and its success in treating clients with emotion dysregulation disorders. But what about clients with <i>overcontrol</i> disorders? OC has been linked to social isolation, aloof and distant relationships, cognitive rigidity, risk aversion, a strong need for structure, inhibited emotional expression, and hyper-perfectionism. And yet&#x2014;perhaps due to the high value our society places on the capacity to delay gratification and inhibit public displays of destructive emotions and impulses&#x2014;problems linked with OC have received little attention or been misunderstood. Indeed, people with OC are often considered highly successful by others, even as they suffer silently and alone.</p><p>RO DBT is based on the premise that psychological well-being involves the confluence of three factors: receptivity, flexibility, and social-connectedness. RO DBT addresses each of these important factors, and is the first treatment in the world to prioritize social-signaling as the primary mechanism of change based on a transdiagnostic, neuroregulatory model linking the communicative function of human emotions to the establishment of social connectedness and well-being. As such, RO DBT is an invaluable resource for treating an array of disorders that center around overcontrol and a lack of social connectedness&#x2014;such as anorexia nervosa, chronic depression, postpartum depression, treatment-resistant anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders, as well as personality disorders such as avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, and paranoid personality disorder.</p><p>In this training manual, you&#x2019;ll find an outline of RO DBT, including history, research, and how it differs from traditional DBT. You&#x2019;ll also find a session-by-session RO DBT outpatient treatment protocol, with sections that outline the weekly, one-hour individual therapy sessions and weekly two-and-a-half hour skills training classes that occur over a period of approximately thirty weeks. This includes instructor guidelines and user-friendly worksheets.</p><p>The feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of RO DBT is evidence-based and informed by over twenty years of translational treatment development research. This important manual&#x2014;along with its companion book, <i>Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy</i> (available separately), distills the essential components of RO DBT into a workable program you can start using right away to improve treatment outcomes for clients suffering with OC.</p></p><p><b>Thomas R. Lynch, PhD, FBPsS</b>, is professor emeritus of clinical psychology at the University of Southampton school of psychology. Previously, he was director of the Duke Cognitive-Behavioral Research and Treatment Program at Duke University from 1998-2007. He relocated to Exeter University in the UK in 2007. Lynch&#x2019;s primary research interests include understanding and developing novel treatments for mood and personality disorders using a translational line of inquiry that combines basic neurobiobehavioral science with the most recent technological advances in intervention research. He is founder of radically open dialectical behavior therapy (RO DBT).<br><br> Lynch has received numerous awards and special recognitions from organizations such as the National Institutes of Health-US (NIMH, NIDA), Medical Research Council-UK (MRC-EME), and the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD). His research has been recognized in the Science and Advances Section of the National Institutes of Health Congressional Justification Report; and he is a recipient of the John M. Rhoades Psychotherapy Research Endowment, and a Beck Institute Scholar.&#x201c;Radically open dialectical behavior therapy (RO DBT) is a truly innovative treatment, developed through translation of neuroscience into clinical practice, integrating various influences from dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness-based approaches, emotion, personality and developmental theory, evolutionary theory, and Malamati Sufism. RO DBT is applicable to a spectrum of disorders characterized by excessive inhibitory control or <i>overcontrol</i> (OC). This is the first treatment that directly targets social signaling and nonverbal aspects of communication not only in clients but also in therapists. ... This book on the theory and practice of RO DBT, together with the skills training manual that describes the content of skills classes, are excellent guides for clinicians who want to embark in delivering transdiagnostic treatments based on science and clinical practice.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Mima Simic, MD, MRCPsych</b>, joint head of the child and adolescent eating disorder service, and consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital in London, UK (Mima Simic, MD, MRCPsych)<br><br>&#x201c;A new and comprehensive statement from one of the more creative minds in evidence-based clinical intervention today, RO DBT brings together a contemporary focus on a limited set of key transdiagnostic processes, with new assessment and intervention techniques for moving them in a positive direction. Emphasizing flexibility, openness, connection, and attention to social signaling, RO DBT specifies the details that can matter, from how you arrange your consulting room furniture to how nonverbal cues signal social information. RO DBT seems destined to make an impact on evidence-based care in many corners of clinical work. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Steven C. Hayes, PhD</b>, codeveloper of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT); Foundation Professor of psychology at the University of Nevada, Reno; and author of <i>Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life</i> (Steven C. Hayes, PhD)<br><br>&#x201c;RO DBT offers an intriguing reconceptualization of traditional views of internalizing and externalizing disorders, and provides the clinician with valuable new tools to address a number of problems that have been particularly resistant to standard CBT approaches. I will definitely include RO DBT theory and techniques in my graduate-level intervention class. I know beginning clinicians in particular will be grateful to have a systematic way to approach these slow-to-warm-up clients who are difficult to establish rapport with. Their early termination from therapy and failure to respond to traditional approaches often leaves clinicians befuddled and critical of their own skills. RO DBT provides a compassionate way for clinicians to view this type of resistant client, as well as to work on some areas that are likely to benefit them.

Mackay begins by examining various economic bubbles, such as the infamous Tulipomania - wherein Dutch tulips rocketed in value amid claims they could be substituted for actual currency - and various follies spread by word of mouth in urban areas. <br><br> As we progress further, the scope of the book broadens into several more exotic fields of mass self-deception. Mackay turns his attention to the witch hunts of the 17th and 18th centuries, the practice of alchemy, the phenomena of haunted houses, the vast and varied practices of fortune telling and the search for the philosopher's stone, to name but a handful of subjects. Informed by personal research, and exhaustive in detail, it is with an evocative conviction that the author excoriates mankind's numerous delusions. <br><br> Further examples of topics in this lengthy book include various claims concerning old relics and artefacts, often involving such items being said to possess religious significance. Mackay saves particular scorn for popular romanticism surrounding the lives of certain criminal scoundrels, whereby said wrongdoers are thought virtuous in popular society; he also notes the marked emergence of quack medicine concurrent with meaningful advances in medical science. The acceptance into society of these phenomena is considered but another facet of the human crowd's inherent madness, feeding into the central thesis of this book. <br><br> Charles Mackay was a journalist used to writing for a popular audience; as such, his book is highly readable and accessible even today. Despite his dogged research and dislike of various delusions, Mackay was not himself immune to participating in them himself; he was involved in the 1840s Railway Mania, and supplemented his interest with newspaper columns in which he assured readers that there was no danger of the railway market crashing. <br><br> Today, <i>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and The Madness of Crowds</i> is distinguished as an expansive, well-researched and somewhat eccentric work of social history.</p><p></p><h2>First the Egg (Caldecott Honor Book and Theodor Seuss Geisel Honor Book (Awards))</h2><p><p>WHICH CAME FIRST? The chicken or the egg? Simple die-cuts magically present transformation-- from seed to flower, tadpole to frog, caterpillar to butterfly.</p><p>The acclaimed author of <i>Black? White! Day? Night! </i>and<i> Lemons Are Not Red</i> gives an entirely fresh and memorable presentation to the concepts of transformation and creatiity. Seed becomes flower, paint becomes picture, word becomes story--and the commonplace becomes extraordinary as children look through and turn the pages of this novel and winning book.</p><p><i>First the Egg </i>by bestselling author and illustrator Laura Vaccaro Seeger is a 2008 Caldecott Honor Book and a 2007 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year. This title has Common Core connections.</p></p><p><b>Laura Vaccaro Seeger</b> has been called "the queen of the concept book by <i>The Horn Book</i> and is the winner of many awards including two Caldecott Honors, two Geisel Honors, and the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award. Her books include <i>The First Egg</i>, <i>One Boy</i>, <i>Green</i>, and the Dog and Bear series.<p>&#x201c;In another nimble page-turner, Seeger (Black? White! Day? Night!) toys with die-cuts and strategically paired words. She introduces a chicken-or-egg dilemma on her book's cover, picturing a plump white egg in a golden-brown nest. Remove the die-cut dust jacket, and a hen appears on the glossy inner cover. The eggshell, thickly brushed in bluish-white and cream, also serves as the chicken's feathers. This "first/then" pattern is repeated ("First the egg/ then the chicken./ First the tadpole/ then the frog"), with a die-cut on every other page. By flipping a page, readers see the cutout in two contexts. For instance, when an ovoid shape is superimposed on a white ground, it's an egg; on a yolk-yellow ground, it's the body of a baby chick. Seeger lines up the recto and verso of every sheet, maintaining a casual mood with generous swabs of grassy greens, sky blues and oxide yellows on canvas. Given the exuberant imagery, the occasional cutout (like the fingernail-size seed of a blowsy peony-pink flower) looks none too impressive. But if minuscule die-cuts seem barely worth the trouble, they do imply the potential in humble sources. Seeger's clever conclusion brings all the elements together in an outdoor scene that returns readers to the opening: "First the paint/ then the picture... / First the chicken/ then the egg!" Ages 2-6. (Sept.)&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;A deceptively simple, decidedly playful sequence of statements invites readers to ponder, what comes first: the chicken or the egg? Carefully choreographed page turns and die-cuts focus on the process of change and becoming, so "First" sits alone on a yellow background, facing "the EGG"--an egg-shaped die-cut revealing a white egg against an orange-and-brown background. Turn the page, and "then" appears, the egg-shaped die-cut now forming the yellow body of a chick emerging from the shell, facing "the CHICKEN"--the white hen whose body gave color to the previous spread's egg. Tadpole and frog, seed and flower, caterpillar and butterfly all receive the same treatment, then word and story, paint and picture bring all the disparate elements together, nature being the catalyst for art. Seeger's vibrant, textured oil-on-canvas illustrations contain a wealth of subtlety, allowing the die-cuts to reveal cunning surprises with each turn of the page. Children and adults alike will delight in flipping the sturdy pages back and forth to recreate the transformations over and over again. Another perfectly pitched triumph from an emerging master of the concept book.

Because of his courageous actions, he remains to this day a model for great leadership and masterful crisis management. Now, through anecdotes, the diaries of the men in his crew, and Shackleton's own writing, Shackleton's leadership style and time-honored principles are translated for the modern business world. Written by two veteran business observers and illustrated with ship photographer Frank Hurley's masterpieces and other rarely seen photos, this practical book helps today's leaders follow Shackleton's triumphant example.<br><br>"An important addition to any leader's library." -<i>Seattle Times</i></p><p>The explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton has recently become the legendary character at the center of a renewed fascination with the early days of Antarctic exploration. Though not the most renowned explorer of his day, nor even the most successful in terms of stated goals, Shackleton's story of adventurous ambition, incredible endurance, and heroic survival against all odds is indeed the stuff of legend. And now, thanks to the detailed research and helpful insights of Morrell and Capparell, his story is also the meaty material of lessons on how to lead with authority, integrity, humor, and compassion.<p> A British explorer once summarized the feats of the great Antarctic explorer like this: "For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organization, give me Scott; for a winter journey, give me Wilson, for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen; and if I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time." His words set the tone for <i>Shackleton's Way</i>, at once both a travel narrative and a handbook of the skills required for effective leadership of diverse groups, especially in times of change and crisis. Shackleton's attempts to reach the South Pole and his two-year fight for the survival of his crew, when their ship is stranded in ice and then sunk, makes for exciting reading. Using this story as the centerpiece of their book, the authors have woven in their interpretation of his success using interviews with exceptional modern leaders such as Mike Dale, Jaguar's former chief of North American operations, and Apollo 13 Commander James Lovell, and by offering useful advice points at the end of each chapter. For example, in the chapter entitled "The Path to Leadership," Shackleton is shown to have been a well-read man, eager to learn and able to mix with varied company. The authors support this by noting that broadening one's horizons and learning to see things from different perspectives will allow for greater flexibility in problem solving. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig agrees that a level of well roundedness is vital in leaders, acknowledging that "one of my prime aims in distributing books is to get people to think outside themselves and to think broadly."</p><p> Morrell and Capparell's excellent use of archival material (especially crew diaries) and their intelligent interpretation of what Shackleton's story implies about good leaders makes this book both pleasurable and educational. Throughout the story of the explorer's exploits, the authors have inserted summarizing subtitles that succinctly capture Shackleton's leadership style. Occasionally, this seems a little strained; while the explorer's progressive attitudes and actions deserve praise as leadership lessons par excellence, even some of his misjudgments are referred to with something approaching reverence. For the most part, however, the authors employ a subtle and effective hand in translating the actions of a man at the helm of a dangerous adventure into advice beneficial to leaders in all areas of life. --<i>S.

All diguised as overgrown underbrush, so nobody knows you have food growing there! This book will show you how to do it in one growing season!</p><p>The Secret Garden of Survival is based on years of research, experimentation and first hand experience on using permaculture concepts in a homestead orchard, vineyard and berry farm.<br><br>These techniques work- amazingly well- because you simply let nature do what it wants to do, instead of trying to force nature to do what man wants it to do. All without using fertilizer, and without using pesticide.<br><br>I have been asked to speak at numerous conferences to talk about my success, and I have been teaching people how to do this on their own homesteads. Many people have asked me to write a book on the subject, so here it is.<br><br>I tried to make the book easy to follow, and easy to read. I tried to make it short and sweet, so people can get down to the meat of the subject. I used a lot of color pictures and illustrations, even though my publishers said this was going to be expensive- I knew it would be better for my readers to actually see how this is done, and with a picture being worth a thousand words, I guess I have saved you from reading over 120,000 additional words, by supplying you with these pictures.<b>Nature has grown&nbsp;food this way for millions of years.</b><br>&nbsp;<br> Studies of native indigenous people around the world (people who have lived off the land for generations without electricity, without refrigeration, without commercial agriculture, and without pesticides and insecticides) showed that these people have lived primarily on perennials (plants that grow year after year without replanting) as opposed to annuals such as your typical grocery store vegetables (crops that you must replant each year).&nbsp; <br> <br>Aside from living off perennial fruits and nuts, these indigenous people also lived on small animal proteins ...In other words, people who have survived for generations, without the modern day comforts of a consumer society, have done so by eating fruits and nuts from the land, as well as small animals - (rabbits, birds, fish, etc.)<br> &nbsp;<br> In a future world where there is potentially no electricity, no refrigeration, no super markets, no seed stores, no fertilizers, no pesticides and no feed stores (for domestic farm animals), it makes sense to look at people who have managed to live successfully for generations without these "conveniences".<br> <br>Furthermore, these people are simply "hunter/gatherers"- so instead of spending their time planting and tending crops, these people spend the majority of their time harvesting their food, without all the "work" that you would typically think of with traditional gardening.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> These people don't plant in rows, they don't plant year after year, they don't weed, they don't fertilize, and they don't water plants in order for the plants to survive long enough to bear fruit.<br> <br>Yet they have managed to survive for hundreds, if not thousands of years this way...<br> &nbsp;<br> If you keep this thought in mind while reading this book, you'll understand that you can create your own "Garden of Eden", which works with nature, instead of against it.&nbsp; A garden that provides you with more and better food than you could ever imagine, with less work than any garden you have ever planted before.&nbsp; And perhaps most important of all, your garden will be disguised to look like "nature", so that no one would ever assume you had food planted there.</p><h2>Dear Deer: A Book of Homophones</h2><p><p>Clever Aunt Ant has just moved to the zoo.

When Sofia is singled out to receive a scholarship to an elite boarding school, she longs to explore life beyond the barrio, even though it means leaving her family to navigate a strange world of rich, privileged kids. It's a different <i>mundo</i>, but one where Sofia's traditions take on new meaning and illuminate her path.</p><p>Viola Canales is the author of <i>Orange Candy Slices and Other Secret Tales </i>(Arte Publico Press). She lives in Stanford, California.TheStoryteller'sBagIn the evenings when the cool breeze began to blow, all the families came out to their porches to sit and talk, to laugh and gossip. And that is where and how our barrio became one family.Dona Clara visited every summer and no one missed her stories, for she came carrying a bag filled with secret things that conjured up the most amazing tales.Clara had a square face on top of a big round body, and the biggest eyes and the widest mouth: she was especially proud of her catfish mouth, which she painted scarlet. She wore a big black onyx tongue around her neck. "This," she said, "is the symbol of a storyteller. It has been handed down from generation to generation, for hundreds of years."When asked where she'd come from, she'd roll her eyes, pitch her arms up to the night sky, and point to the stars with her long scarlet fingernails. So the other kids and I believed she'd just flown down from a star.Then she'd shake her many wooden bracelets and thrust her hand into her mysterious bag. She rattled her things around as we stared, bug-eyed.Clara sucked her front teeth, batted her eyes, and then slowly started lifting something out of her bag. You could hear your blood go thump! thump! thump!Once, she pulled out a three-inch lock of hair. "This belonged to Mama Maria, your great-great-grandmother."&nbsp; As the lock of dark hair made its way from hand to hand, person to person, Clara said, "Your Mama Maria was a mule. Always kicking her way through things. A force to behold! But beautiful, with the darkest eyes and long, wild Apache hair. This hair."And you, Sofia"--Clara pointed at me--"not only look like her, but have inherited her gift for mule-kicking." I gasped. My cousin Berta laughed.&nbsp; Papa was sitting beside me on top of an upside-down pail. "Mi'ja, don't look so worried. This is a good thing--for things to kick will come your way in many shapes and sizes. You'll see."Next Clara pulled out a jar full of big mule teeth with a piece of a blue balloon inside. "I always show the hair and teeth and blue balloon together," she said, "for the teeth belonged to Papa Carlos, your great-great-grandfather, Mama Maria's husband, and he gave this blue balloon to her when they met and fell in love in a little Mexican plaza far away. The town plaza, in those days, was where people gathered to tell their tales." Oh no! I thought. Please don't say I inherited those teeth, too! But Clara pointed at Berta, who bit her lip and covered her big mouth with her hand. Now I laughed."Hija, the big teeth are a good gift too," said Berta's mother, T&#x2019;a Belia, "if you learn to use them right." And as the jar of teeth made its way around, Clara told us, "Look closely at them, for they once bit a rattlesnake in half, chewed a mountain of tobacco, and helped yell out the longest string of insults imaginable."Yes, kicking and biting like mules runs deep in our blood. Never forget that, for it might come in handy someday."The things Clara pulled out of her bag included chipped saints, wacky handmade dolls, arrowheads, recipes, cracked old photos of stiff people, and pictures of dead children, who looked beautiful and peacefully asleep.Clara always stayed a couple of days and then disappeared. "I have to go visit other families, other barrios, for it's important that they also hear these stories." But before leaving she'd reach into her bag one last time to pull out a tiny bottle of mescal. She'd take a hairpin and fish out the tequila worm swimming inside. "This will cure my homesickness as I travel to my next family," Clara would say, popping the tequila worm into her mouth and chewing. She swallowed loudly as we stared. I was amazed. Sick, too. "Now, is there some story you want me to tell as I continue on my journey?"I'd shake my head. There was nothing I'd want her to tell, at least nothing that could possibly compare with the stories that went with the big teeth, the lock of hair, and especially the tequila worm.When I was about six, Clara came to visit as usual, but this time she was in a wheelchair. And when we gathered around her on the porch, we saw that her big mouth had collapsed into a thin line and her popping eyes gazed out at nothing.Mama kissed Clara's trembling white hair and placed her story bag at the center of the porch. She reached inside and slowly pulled out her cupped hand. There was nothing in it. But Mama handed the invisible thing to me and said, "Here is the ceramic baby Jesus for the manger of the Christmas nacimiento your abuelita builds each year. It represents the vivid image Clara gave me of my great-grandmother Maria, who I never met, but who I feel close to through her story: about how she worked for weeks, making tamales and then going door to door selling them so she could buy a brand-new baby Jesus for her daughter, my mother, who was appointed the Christmas madrina, the godmother for baby Jesus that year." This image was passed around from hand to hand, person to person."Sofia, you're next!" Mama said. "Reach into the bag and see what secret is inside for you." I put my hand in and felt all around. Empty. I pulled out my cupped hand and showed everyone. I hesitated, then turned to look at Clara. "This is the black onyx tongue that Clara still wears around her neck. I look at it and remember all the stories Clara has told us. Our stories.""Yes," said Mama. "Clara is a perfect example of a good comadre.""A good comadre?" I said.</p><h2>Heroes of Olympus, The, Book Two: Son of Neptune, The: The Graphic Novel-The Heroes of Olympus, Book Two</h2><p><strong>Percy is confused.</strong> When he awoke after his long sleep, he didn't know much more than his name.

It's why she has no raisins for her cereal, and it's why her new dress isn't ready for her to wear to school. She thinks she may run away after dinner. And she does! She takes her carefully packed knapsack and settles in under the dining-room table. <p> As she sits sulking and eating cookies, her mother and father, fully aware of her presence, begin talking about how much they miss her, and how much they love her little songs, and how a family is <i>everybody all together</i>, not just a baby. Frances can't stand it anymore. She calls them from her imaginary telephone and tells them she'll be home soon.

Perhaps it is this eternal quest that led me to the discovery of this most amazing system. When a friend handed me an old book about the cards and said, "Here, look up your card and see what it says about you," I was doubtful. How could any system based solely upon my birthday have anything relevant to say about me? I was an astrologer after all, and as many people know, an astrology chart requires the date, time, and place of our birth to be accurate. Still, I was interested and read a small section about my Birth Card. I was stunned a little after reading it. First of all, it was telling me things about myself that were true, but they were qualities that I hadn't accepted about myself. I felt the book was a little negative on my card, the Queen of Diamonds, but I had to admit that it was an accurate portrayal. Something inside told me that I had stumbled upon a gemstone of knowledge. My second sense about books and information has always been accurate and I knew then and there that this information came from a high and genuine source of spiritual truth.</p> <p>I immediately acquired a copy of that book, called Sacred Symbols of the Ancients, and began reading up on everyone I knew. My thirst for more information was growing each day. But as I searched and searched, I could find no other books about this mysterious card system. There were lots of books on reading playing cards, but none gave me the feeling this book did. After about a year, I finally gave up searching, resigning myself to the reality that there really were no other books on this subject.</p> <p>A couple of months later I made a big move to Los Angeles. Strangely enough, within two weeks of moving there a friend came over and noticed Sacred Symbols on my book shelf. "You have that book too?" she said. "Did you know there is a man in town who has written another book about the cards? His name is Arne Lein and he has been teaching classes about it." To make a long story short, I met Arne Lein, took classes from him, and received my initiation into this wonderful body of information. Over a year later, after Arne passed away, I dedicated myself to introducing this system to the world and began writing my first book about it.</p> <p>About six years ago I had a reading done by a prominent psychic in Los Angeles. Most of the reading was useless mumbo jumbo, but at one point in the reading the psychic stopped what he was talking about and said, "Your deceased aunt, Elizabeth, wants to tell you something and she won't leave me alone until I tell you this." I told him to go ahead and he said, "She was an author herself. She knows you are writing books and she wanted me to tell you that when you write your book, think about creating a book that would be the book you have been looking for your entire life. Think about what book would make you feel like you had found the most valuable treasure in the world. Then, go out and write that book."</p> <p>I took some notes and he went on with the rest of his reading. But that one message made a lasting impression on me. The feeling Aunt Elizabeth described is how I felt when I discovered Sacred Symbols. Honestly, there have been several other books that have made me feel that way and each one of them proved to be invaluable in my life, giving me priceless information that helped me to transform aspects of my life. I hope Love Cards has that impact for you.</p> <p>When I meet people today, I immediately ask them their birthday. Once I know their birthday, I usually know more about them than they know about themselves. I constantly study people and learn more and more about them through the use of this system. This knowledge gives a certain kind of power. I can make predictions about people that come true 90 percent of the time. Knowing a person's card tells what to expect from them and gives an idea of how we will relate with one another. It gives an understanding of life that brings great joy.</p> <p>It has also helped me to understand and accept myself. Much of the pain and suffering of my early life is gone, partly because I am no longer fighting with myself so much. I have come to accept myself in areas where I used to be in turmoil and conflict. And I believe this is one of the most priceless gifts this system has to offer. If you read this book and are able to understand and accept yourself a little more, then I have been successful. </p> <p>But the potential is here for much more than that. There are literally hundreds of uses for this information,all of which will help your life and the life of those you love. The truth is really a loving thing. It spreads light wherever it goes, releasing much of the tension we experience from misunderstandings and inner conflicts. And as the wise man Swami Kripalu Vanandji once said:</p> <p>Where there is darkness, let there be light.<br> Where there is sadness, let there be joy.<br> Where there is ignorance, let there be truth.<br> Where there is hate and anger, let there be love.</p> <p>Best wishes in your personal path to light, joy, truth, and love.

On one side, the Durupinen, determined to capture the girls and prevent their role in an ancient prophecy that promises to destroy them and unleash the spirit hordes on the earth. On the other side, the Necromancers, ancient enemies of the Durupinen, hellbent on bringing the same prophecy to fruition. When the girls are betrayed and one of them falls into the Necromancers&#x2019; hands, both face decisions with cataclysmic consequences.</p><p>Will the lure of power prove too great to resist, or will the bond between the sisters survive this last, most crucial of tests?</p><p><i>Spirit Ascendancy</i> is the much anticipated third and final installment of E.E. Holmes&#x2019; award-winning <i>Gateway Trilogy</i>.</p></p><p>E.E. Holmes grew up near Boston, Massachusetts, where she spent the majority of her childhood reading books. She read them almost constantly, and as a result, perfected the art of walking and reading at the same time, a skill she can still perform to this day with remarkably few instances of falling on her face. She also wrote many books and poems in blank books and on the backs of legal pads her father brought home from the office. They remain some of her finest work. She soon learned to love literature of the dramatic persuasion, and earned a B.A. in theater from the College of the Holy Cross. After graduation, she set out to prove that her degree was, in fact, not useless, and worked as a principal actor in a summer Shakespeare festival and as a theater teacher, directing over thirty productions and numerous workshops for youth and high school students. She spent seven years as the theater director at Wakefield High School where she also taught English literature and public speaking. It was in her classroom that she discovered the horrible truth: a disturbingly large percentage of high school students hate to read. This revelation devastated and bewildered her. She decided she wanted to do something about it, and thus she started work on her first young adult novel, Spirit Legacy: Book 1 of the Gateway Trilogy, which has gone on to win awards from Chanticleer Book Reviews and Media and The Independent Publisher Book Awards. She is also the author of Spirit Prophecy, Book 2 of the Gateway Trilogy, and three one act plays, one of which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2009 to rave reviews. E.E. Holmes lives in central Massachusetts with her husband, two children, and small, but surprisingly loud dog. When not writing, she enjoys watching unhealthy amounts of British television, procrastinating, and rediscovering her favorite books from her childhood all over again with her kids.</p><h2>4th Edition, The Ultimate Guide to SAT Grammar Workbook</h2><p>The accompanying workbook to <i>The Ultimate Guide to SAT� Grammar</i> contains eight full-length tests in redesigned SAT format, each accompanied by thorough explanations designed to reinforce the concepts and strategies covered in the main grammar book.</p><p></p><h2>Tao Te Ching: The New Translation from Tao Te Ching, The Definitive Edition (Tarcher Cornerstone Editions)</h2><p>In the hands of Jonathan Star, the eighty-one verses of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> resound with the elegant, simple images and all-penetrating ideas that have made this ancient work a cornerstone of the world's wisdom literature.</p><p>The TAO-TE-CHING, the ancient Taoist text written by philospher Lao-Tzu in the sixth century B.C., has inspired millions of people from all different backgrounds.

She was eight and already restless with Mom&#x2019;s chore of the day, planting jonquil bulbs in our front garden. Walking quickly to the picket fence that divided our house from the one next door, she perched on her tiptoes to peer at the new neighbors. I pressed my face to the gap in the slats, watching in amazement as two parents and five children spilled from the sedan, like a clown car at the circus.</p><p>&#x201c;This kind of thing.&#x201d; Mom gestured toward the car with the trowel, twisting her silvery blond hair into a coil with the other hand. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s one in every neighborhood. The family that never mows their lawn. Has toys scattered everywhere. The ones who never plant flowers, or do and let them die. The messy family who lowers real estate values. Here they are. Right next door. You&#x2019;ve got that bulb wrong side up, Samantha.&#x201d;</p><p>I switched the bulb around, scooting my knees in the dirt to get closer to the fence, my eyes never leaving the father as he swung a baby from a car seat while a curly-haired toddler climbed his back. &#x201c;They look nice,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>I remember there was a silence then, and I looked up at my mother.</p><p>She was shaking her head at me, a strange expression on her face. &#x201c;Nice isn&#x2019;t the point here, Samantha. You&#x2019;re seven years old. You need to understand what&#x2019;s important. <i>Five</i> children. Good God. Just like your father&#x2019;s family. Insanity.&#x201d; She shook her head again, rolling her eyes heavenward.</p><p>I moved closer to Tracy and edged a fleck of white paint off the fence with my thumbnail. My sister looked at me with the same warning face she used when she was watching TV and I walked up to ask her a question.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>He&#x2019;s</i> cute,&#x201d; she said, squinting over the fence again. I looked over to see an older boy unfold himself from the back of the car, baseball mitt in hand, reaching back to haul out a cardboard box full of sports gear.</p><p>Even then, Tracy liked to deflect, to forget how hard our mother found being a parent. Our dad had walked away without even a good-bye, leaving Mom with a one-year-old, a baby on the way, a lot of disillusionment, and, luckily, her trust fund from her parents.</p><p>As the years proved, our new neighbors, the Garretts, were exactly what Mom predicted. Their lawn got mowed sporadically at best. Their Christmas lights stayed hung till Easter. Their backyard was a hodgepodge of an in-ground pool and a trampoline and a swing set and monkey bars. Periodically, Mrs. Garrett would make an effort to plant something seasonal, chrysanthemums in September, impatiens in June, only to leave it to gasp and wither away as she tended to something more important, like her five children. They became eight children over the years. All approximately three years apart.</p><p>&#x201c;My unsafe zone,&#x201d; I overheard Mrs. Garrett explain one day at the supermarket when Mrs. Mason commented on her burgeoning belly, &#x201c;is twenty-two months. That&#x2019;s when they suddenly aren&#x2019;t babies anymore. I love babies so much.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Mason had raised her eyebrows and smiled, then turned away with compressed lips and a baffled shake of her head.</p><p>But Mrs. Garrett seemed to ignore it, happy in herself and content with her chaotic family. Five boys and three girls by the time I turned seventeen.</p><p>Joel, Alice, Jase, Andy, Duff, Harry, George, and Patsy.</p><p>In the ten years since the Garretts moved next door, Mom hardly ever looked out the side windows of our house without huffing an impatient breath. Too many kids on the trampoline. Bikes abandoned on the lawn. Another pink or blue balloon tied to the mailbox, waving haphazardly in the breeze. Loud basketball games. Music blaring while Alice and her friends tanned. The bigger boys washing cars and spraying each other with hoses. If not those, it was Mrs. Garrett, calmly breast-feeding on the front steps, or sitting there on Mr. Garrett&#x2019;s lap, for all the world to see.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s indecent,&#x201d; Mom would say, watching.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s legal,&#x201d; Tracy, future lawyer, always countered, flipping back her platinum hair. She&#x2019;d station herself next to Mom, inspecting the Garretts out the big side window of the kitchen. &#x201c;The courts have made it absolutely legal to breast-feed wherever you want. Her own front steps are definitely fair game.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But why? Why do it at all when there are bottles and formula? And if you <i>must,</i> why not inside?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s watching the other kids, Mom. It&#x2019;s what she&#x2019;s supposed to do,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d sometimes point out, making my stand next to Tracy.</p><p>Mom would sigh, shake her head, and extract the vacuum cleaner from the closet as if it were a Valium. The lullaby of my childhood was my mom running the vacuum cleaner, making perfectly symmetrical lines in our beige living room carpet. The lines somehow seemed important to her, so essential that she&#x2019;d turn on the machine as Tracy and I were eating breakfast, then slowly follow us to the door as we pulled on our coats and backpacks. Then she&#x2019;d back up, eliminating our trail of footprints, and her own, until we were outside. Finally, she&#x2019;d rest the vacuum cleaner carefully behind one of our porch columns only to drag it back in that night when she got home from work.</p><p>It was clear from the start that we were <i>not to play with the Garretts</i>. After bringing over the obligatory &#x201c;welcome to the neighborhood&#x201d; lasagna, my mother did her best to be very unwelcoming. She responded to Mrs. Garrett&#x2019;s smiling greetings with cool nods. She rebuffed Mr. Garrett&#x2019;s offers to mow, sweep up leaves, or shovel snow with a terse &#x201c;We have a service, thanks all the same.&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, the Garretts stopped trying.</p><p>Though they lived right next door and one kid or another might pedal past me as I watered Mom&#x2019;s flowers, it was easy not to run into them. Their kids went to the local public schools. Tracy and I attended Hodges, the only private school in our small Connecticut town.</p><p>One thing my mother never knew, and would disapprove of most of all, was that I watched the Garretts. All the time.</p><p>Outside my bedroom window, there&#x2019;s a small flat section of the roof with a tiny fence around it. Not really a balcony, more like a ledge. It&#x2019;s in between two peaked gables, shielded from both the front and backyard, and it faces the right side of the Garretts&#x2019; house. Even before they came, it was my place to sit and think. But afterward, it was my place to dream.</p><p>I&#x2019;d climb out after bedtime, look through the lit windows, and see Mrs. Garrett doing the dishes, one of the younger kids sitting on the counter next to her. Or Mr. Garrett wrestling with the older boys in the living room. Or the lights going on where the baby must sleep, the figure of Mr. or Mrs. Garrett pacing back and forth, rubbing a tiny back. It was like watching a silent movie, one so different from the life I lived.</p><p>Over the years, I got more daring. I&#x2019;d sometimes watch during the day, after school, hunched back against the side of the rough gable, trying to figure out which Garrett matched each name I heard called out the screen door. It was tricky because they all had wavy brown hair, olive skin, and sinewy builds, like a breed all their own.</p><p>Joel was the easiest to identify&#x2014;the oldest and the most athletic. His picture often appeared in local papers for various sports accomplishments&#x2014;I knew it in black and white. Alice, next in line, dyed her hair outlandish colors and wore clothes that provoked commentary from Mrs. Garrett, so I had her down as well. George and Patsy were the littlest ones. The middle three boys, Jase, Duff, and Harry...I couldn&#x2019;t get them straight. I was pretty sure that Jase was the oldest of the three, but did that mean he was the tallest? Duff was supposed to be the smart one, competing in various chess competitions and spelling bees, but he didn&#x2019;t wear glasses or give off any obvious brainiac signals. Harry was constantly in trouble&#x2014;&#x201c;Harry! How could you?&#x201d; was the refrain. And Andy, the middle girl, always seemed to be missing, her name called longest to come to the dinner table or pile into the car: &#x201c;Annnnnnnnndeeeeeeeeee!&#x201d;</p><p>From my hidden perch, I&#x2019;d peer out at the yard, trying to locate Andy, figure out Harry&#x2019;s latest escapade, or see what outrageous outfit Alice was wearing. The Garretts were my bedtime story, long before I ever thought I&#x2019;d be part of the story myself.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>On the first sweltering hot night in June, I&#x2019;m home alone, trying to enjoy the quiet but finding myself moving from room to room, unable to settle.</p><p>Tracy&#x2019;s out with Flip, yet another blond tennis player in her unending series of boyfriends. I can&#x2019;t reach my best friend, Nan, who&#x2019;s been completely distracted by <i>her</i> boyfriend, Daniel, since school ended last week and he graduated. There&#x2019;s nothing on TV I want to see, no place in town I feel like going. I&#x2019;ve tried sitting out on the porch, but at low tide the humid air is overpowering, muddy-scented from the breeze off the river.</p><p>So I&#x2019;m sitting in our vaulted living room, crunching the ice left over from my seltzer, skimming through Tracy&#x2019;s stack of <i>In Touch</i> magazines. Suddenly I hear a loud, continuous buzzing sound. As it goes on and on I look around, alarmed, trying to identify it. The dryer? The smoke detector? Finally, I realize it&#x2019;s the doorbell, buzzing and buzzing, on and on and on. I hurry to open the door, expecting&#x2014;sigh&#x2014;one of Tracy&#x2019;s exes, daring after too many strawberry daiquiris at the country club, come to win her back.</p><p>Instead, I see my mother, pressed against the doorbell, getting the daylights kissed out of her by some man. When I throw the door open, they half stumble, then he braces his hand on the jamb and just keeps kissing away. So I stand there, feeling stupid, arms folded, my thin nightgown shifting slightly in the thick air. All around me are summer voices. The lap of the shore far away, the roar of a motorcycle coming up the street, the <i>shhhh</i> of the wind in the dogwood trees. None of those, and certainly not my presence, stop my mom or this guy. Not even when the motorcycle backfires as it peels into the Garretts&#x2019; driveway, which usually drives Mom crazy.</p><p>Finally, they come up for air, and she turns to me with an awkward laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;Samantha. Goodness! You startled me.&#x201d;</p><p>She&#x2019;s flustered, her voice high and girlish. Not the authoritative &#x201c;this is how it will be&#x201d; voice she typically uses at home or the syrup-mixed-with-steel one she wields on the job.</p><p>Five years ago, Mom went into politics. Tracy and I didn&#x2019;t take it seriously at first&#x2014;we&#x2019;d hardly known Mom to vote. But she came home one day from a rally charged up and determined to be state senator. She ran, and she won, and our lives changed entirely.</p><p>We were proud of her. Of course we were. But instead of making breakfast and sifting through our book bags to be sure our homework was done, Mom left home at five o&#x2019;clock in the morning and headed to Hartford &#x201c;before the traffic kicks in.&#x201d; She stayed late for commissions and special sessions. Weekends weren&#x2019;t about Tracy&#x2019;s gymnastics practices or my swim meets. They were for boning up on upcoming votes, staying for special sessions, or attending local events. Tracy pulled every bad-teenager trick in the book. She played with drugs and drinking, she shoplifted, she slept with too many boys. I read piles of books, registered Democratic in my mind (Mom&#x2019;s Republican), and spent more time than usual watching the Garretts.</p><p>So now tonight, I stand here, stunned into immobility by the unexpected and prolonged PDA, until Mom finally lets go of the guy. He turns to me and I gasp.</p><p>After a man leaves you, pregnant and with a toddler, you don&#x2019;t keep his picture on the mantel. We have only a few photographs of our dad, and they&#x2019;re all in Tracy&#x2019;s room. Still I recognize him&#x2014;the curve of his jaw, the dimples, the shiny wheat-blond hair and broad shoulders. This man has all those things.</p><p>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d;</p><p>Mom&#x2019;s expression morphs from dreamy bedazzlement to utter shock, as though I&#x2019;ve cursed.</p><p>The guy shifts away from Mom, extends his hand to me. As he moves into the light of the living room, I realize he&#x2019;s much younger than my father would be now. &#x201c;Hi there, darlin&#x2019;. I&#x2019;m the newest&#x2014;and most enthusiastic&#x2014;member of your mom&#x2019;s reelection campaign.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Enthusiastic? I&#x2019;ll say.</i></p><p>He takes my hand and shakes it, seemingly without my participation.</p><p>&#x201c;This is Clay Tucker,&#x201d; Mom says, in the reverent tone one might use for Vincent van Gogh or Abraham Lincoln. She turns and gives me a reproving look, no doubt for the &#x201c;Dad&#x201d; comment, but quickly recovers. &#x201c;Clay&#x2019;s worked on national campaigns. I&#x2019;m very lucky he&#x2019;s agreed to help me out.&#x201d;</p><p><i>In what capacity?</i> I wonder as she fluffs her hair in a gesture that can&#x2019;t possibly be anything but flirtatious. <i>Mom?</i></p><p>&#x201c;So, Clay,&#x201d; she continues. &#x201c;I <i>told</i> you Samantha was a big girl.&#x201d;</p><p>I blink. I&#x2019;m five two. In heels. &#x201c;Big girl&#x201d; is a stretch. Then I get it. She means old. Old for someone as young as her to have.</p><p>&#x201c;Clay was mighty surprised to find I had a teenager.&#x201d; My mother tucks a wayward strand of newly fluffed hair behind her ear. &#x201c;He says I look like one myself.&#x201d;</p><p>I wonder if she&#x2019;s mentioned Tracy, or if she&#x2019;s going to keep her on the down-low for a while.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re as beautiful as your mother,&#x201d; he says to me, &#x201c;so now I believe it.&#x201d; He has the kind of Southern accent that makes you think of melting butter on biscuits, and porch swings.</p><p>Clay looks around the living room. &#x201c;What a terrific room,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Just invites a man to put his feet up after a long hard day.&#x201d; Mom beams. She&#x2019;s proud of our house, renovates rooms all the time, tweaking the already perfect. He walks around slowly, examining the gigantic paintings of landscapes on the white, white walls, taking in the so-puffy-you-can&#x2019;t-sit-on-it beige couch and the immense armchairs, finally settling into the one in front of the fireplace. I&#x2019;m shocked. I check Mom&#x2019;s face. Her dates always stop at the door. In fact, she&#x2019;s barely dated at all.</p><p>But Mom doesn&#x2019;t do her usual thing, glance at her watch, say, &#x201c;Oh, goodness, look at the time,&#x201d; and politely shove him out the door. Instead, she gives that little girlish laugh again, toys with a pearl earring, and says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just make coffee.&#x201d;</p><p>She whirls toward the kitchen, but before she can take a step, Clay Tucker comes up to me, putting his hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;Seems to me,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re the kind of girl who&#x2019;d make the coffee herself and let her mama relax.&#x201d;</p><p>My face heats and I take an involuntary step back. Fact is, I usually do make tea for Mom when she comes in late. It&#x2019;s sort of a ritual. But no one has ever told me to do it. Part of me thinks I must have misheard. I met this guy, like, two seconds ago. The other part instantly fee...</p></p><h2>The Canary Caper (A to Z Mysteries)</h2><p><p><b>Help Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose solve mysteries from A to Z! </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Kids love collecting the entire alphabet and super editions!

During that time I was immersed in black history and the many courageous African-Americans that history books had overlooked. I was surprised at how many inventors that affected our everyday life had been left out of what we learned in school. I knew at that time that I would someday want to do something about that inequity.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Super Soaker or Illusion Transmitter? Of the many inventions you talk about in the book, which is your favorite?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> My favorite invention in the book is the foil-electret microphone invented by James West because it has made cell phone communication possible. The cell phone has completely changed our world. Today&#x2019;s kids can&#x2019;t imagine a time before there were cell phones or iPods or iPads. But all that was possible, in part, thanks to one black man who had to struggle against great odds to achieve his dream. Those are the kind of men and women we should be exposing our children to.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> In <i>What Color is My World?</i> Herbie keeps a journal with him all the time--do you keep a journal?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I don&#x2019;t keep a journal, but I do tweet on Twitter and have a Facebook site, which are the modern equivalents. However, Herbie&#x2019;s journal is the kind I would have kept and wish I had as a child. It&#x2019;s filled with the sense of wonder he has about the world. I had that same sense of wonder but I was a little too restless to write it all down. I&#x2019;m trying to make up for all that now with the books I write.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What was your favorite class in school?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I don&#x2019;t think it will be any surprise that my favorite class was history. I&#x2019;ve said many times that if I hadn&#x2019;t become a professional basketball player, I would have become a history teacher. There&#x2019;s so much to learn from history. The saying, &#x201c;Those that don&#x2019;t learn from history are condemned to repeat it&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t just apply to politicians and world leaders, it applies to all of us on a daily basis. We can learn from mistakes of others, whether they&#x2019;re kings or our parents. When we do learn those lessons, we&#x2019;re better equipped to make our own dreams come true.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What do you most want kids to know about you outside of your legendary basketball career?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I love basketball, but playing basketball doesn&#x2019;t fully define who I am. I was always a good student, too. Sure, I could have skated by as an athlete, but the world is so much bigger and more interesting than any one thing. I didn&#x2019;t want to be pigeonholed as just a jock. I&#x2019;m also an author, a student of history, and I collect memorabilia from the Wild West. I&#x2019;m also a son, a father, and a friend.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did you read a lot as a kid? Did you have any favorite books growing up?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I read a lot as a kid. Some of my favorite books were <em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> by Robert Louis Stevenson, <em>The Three Musketeers</em> by Alexander Dumas and <i>The Man Who Would Be King</i> by Rudyard Kipling. Reading opened up the world like nothing else. One day I might be sword fighting in 17th Century France, the next I might be fighting off crazed assassins in 19th Century India. Video games just can&#x2019;t compare with the variety and intensity of reading.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What was it like to receive the Abraham Lincoln Medal [awarded to individuals who exemplify President Abraham Lincoln's commitment to equality in their body of work, accomplishments or personal attributes] and meet the President and First Lady?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> It was a great honor, truly unforgettable. One of the great things about growing older is that you can see some of your childhood dreams about the world come true. When I was a kid I imagined a day when we would have an African-American president. I imagined a day when children of all races would play together without fear or prejudice. The world isn&#x2019;t perfect, but we&#x2019;re heading in the right direction and I just want to play my part in making this a better world. I hope my books are a step in that direction.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Will you write more books for kids? If so, do you have an idea for the next one yet?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I have so many ideas I&#x2019;d like to tackle. There&#x2019;s no shortage in my imagination. History is filled with so many amazing people and I would like to bring them to light so they can inspire all of us--young and old--to become the kind of people we want to be.</p><b>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</b> is one of the most famous and accomplished basketball players in U.S. history.

Now, more than ever, this book provides an important change in perspective regarding our right to medicines already found in nature. This book provides an overview of Rick Simpson's experiences with patients suffering from a variety of medical conditions such as: CANCER SKIN CONDITIONS LEUKEMIA DIABETES INFLAMMATIONS, ARTHRITIS CHRONIC PAIN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) BURNS ANXIETY, PARANOIA DEPRESSION INSOMNIA VITAL ORGANS AIDS AUTISM, MENTAL DISORDERS GLAUCOMA, VISION HEART, BLOOD PRESSURE amongst others. These patients have used the cannabis oil he was making and giving away freely while still living in Canada and growing cannabis plants in his own back yard. The positive results these people have achived with the use of Rick Simpson Oil is what has earned Rick Simpson the title of being the 'grandfather of cannabis oil'. Namely, it was Rick Simpson who first rediscovered the healing properties of cannabis oil back in 2003 when he first cured his own skin cancer using the cannabis oil he had made himslef. The book also continues to relate the story of how he tried to make this information available to all. This is Rick Simpson's second book, while his first is the autobiography titled 'Phoenix Tears - The Rick Simpson Story' which relates his story from his discovery in 2003, up until 2012 when he moved to Europe.</p><p></p><h2>The Midcentury Modern Landscape</h2><p><p><i>The Midcentury Modern Landscape</i> explores the origins of midcentury modern garden design for the home, revealing how designers at the time blurred the divisions between indoors and outdoors, creating gardens that were for living, a style that went on to inspire contemporary gardens around the world.</p><p> </p><p><i>The Midcentury Modern Landscape</i> is a fresh guide for those seeking bold approaches to redefine their outdoor space, or wishing to learn more about the history of mid century modern aesthetics.</p> <p><b>Ethne Clarke</b> is an award-winning journalist, former garden editor of <i>Traditional Home,</i> and contributing editor for <i>House &amp; Garden</i>.

If work is our national religion, Pang is the philosopher reintegrating our bifurcated selves."</b><b>---Arianna Huffington, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>Overwork is the new normal. Rest is something to do when the important things are done-but they are never done. Looking at different forms of rest, from sleep to vacation, Silicon Valley futurist and business consultant Alex Soojung-Kim Pang dispels the myth that the harder we work the better the outcome. He combines rigorous scientific research with a rich array of examples of writers, painters, and thinkers---from Darwin to Stephen King---to challenge our tendency to see work and relaxation as antithetical. "Deliberate rest," as Pang calls it, is the true key to productivity, and will give us more energy, sharper ideas, and a better life. <i>Rest </i>offers a roadmap to rediscovering the importance of rest in our lives, and a convincing argument that we need to relax more if we actually want to get more done.</p><p>I became interested in the importance of rest in creative lives began when I noticed a paradox: many of history's most accomplished thinkers, artists, writers, and composers organized their lives around their work, but not their days. Figures as diverse as Charles Darwin, Salvador Dali, and Maya Angelou think about their work constantly, and achieve much more than most of us, yet they spend fewer hours <b>laboring</b> than we do. What accounts for their success?<br>The key is not the quantity of their work, but the quality of their rest. Many super-creative and -productive people take a distinctive approach to rest.&nbsp;<ul><li>They see rest as a skill: like speaking or running, it's something we all do naturally, and can learn to do better.&nbsp;</li><li>They learn to harness mind-wandering: they develop habits that give their brains a break, or give their unconscious minds time to explore new ideas.&nbsp;</li><li>They treat rest with respect, and make time for it in their daily schedules.&nbsp;</li><li>They recognize rest as a resource that can extend their creative lives.</li></ul><i>Rest</i>&nbsp;blends history, biography, and recent work in neuroscience and psychology to uncover the critical but under-recognized role rest plays in the lives of creative people. It shows how creative figures structure their days to make good use of rest, and why long walks, afternoon naps, vigorous exercise, and "deep play" stimulate creative work and sustain creative lives.<b>Alex Soojung-Kim Pang </b>is the founder of the Restful Company and a visiting scholar at Stanford University.

Bush honoring the sacrifice and courage of America&#x2019;s military veterans.</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>With Forewords by former First Lady Laura Bush and General Peter Pace, 16th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</b><br><br> Growing out of President Bush&#x2019;s own outreach and the ongoing work of the George W. Bush Institute's Military Service Initiative, <i>Portraits of Courage </i>brings together sixty-six full-color portraits and a four-panel mural painted by President Bush of members of the United States military who have served our nation with honor since 9/11&#x2014;and whom he has come to know personally. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Our men and women in uniform have faced down enemies, liberated millions, and in doing so showed the true compassion of our nation. Often, they return home with injuries&#x2014;both visible and invisible&#x2014;that intensify the challenges of transitioning into civilian life. In addition to these burdens, research shows a civilian-military divide. Seventy-one percent of Americans say they have little understanding of the issues facing veterans, and veterans agree: eighty-four percent say that the public has "little awareness" of the issues facing them and their families.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each painting in this meticulously produced hardcover volume is accompanied by the inspiring story of the veteran depicted, written by the President. Readers can see the faces of those who answered the nation&#x2019;s call and learn from their bravery on the battlefield, their journeys to recovery, and the continued leadership and contributions they are making as civilians.&nbsp;It is President Bush&#x2019;s desire that these stories of courage and resilience will honor our men and women in uniform, highlight their family and caregivers who bear the burden of their sacrifice, and help Americans understand how we can support our veterans and empower them to succeed.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> President Bush will donate his net author proceeds from <b><i>PORTRAITS OF COURAGE</i></b><i> </i>to the George W. Bush Presidential Center, a non-profit organization whose Military Service Initiative works to ensure that post-9/11 veterans and their families make successful transitions to civilian life with a focus on gaining meaningful employment and overcoming the invisible wounds of war.</p><p><b>George W. Bush</b>&nbsp;is the 43rd President of the United States, serving from 2001 to 2009. He previously served as Governor of Texas. He and his wife, Laura, now live in Dallas, where they founded the George W. Bush Presidential Center at Southern Methodist University. President Bush is also the author of three #1 bestsellers: <i>Decision Points,</i> his presidential memoir;&nbsp;<i>41</i>, a biography of his father, President George H.W.

Accompanying the portraits are stories, also written by Bush, about how each subject dealt with setback and then mounted a recovery.

There is genuine empathy in Bush&#x2019;s embrace of the stories told by these soldiers . . . He demonstrates in this book and in these paintings virtues that are sadly lacking at the top of the American political pyramid today: curiosity, compassion, the commitment to learn something new and the humility to learn it in public.&#x201d; <br> <b>-Philip Kennicott, <i>the Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[It&#x2019;s] impossible to look at these 98 extraordinary images without thinking deeply about the artist who made them: A leader who sent troops off to the battlefield, and who, so many years later, spends his days channeling the damaged but determined warriors who came home . . .

ENTER THE SOUL OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.Power Animals have served humanity as our spiritual protectors, teachers, messengers, companions, and helpers since our prehistoric ancestors walked the Earth. Shamans have always relied heavily on their wisdom, healing medicine, and partnership. Whether in the mystery schools of ancient Egypt and Greece or in the ceremonial and folk traditions of Native America, Africa, and Europe, it is recognized that the embodiment of animal characteristics, the revelation of their symbolism, and their timely appearance can bring us deeper insights and empowerment. The Shaman&#x2019;s Guide to Power Animals is a cross-cultural journey into the mystical symbolism and stories of over 200 birds, fish, insects, and mammals drawn from ancient and indigenous cultures worldwide. It is a spiritual tool for understanding omens when an animal crosses your path or appears in a dream, or to apply in situations where you need protection or want to chart a course or locate resources. Incorporating channeled messages from the Power Animals, it explains:&gt; What Power Animals are and how to identify yours.&gt; Rituals, prayers, and affirmations you can use to ask a Power Animal for its help. &gt; Archetypal powers associated with different Power Animals and ways to activate them. &gt; How a Power Animal can act as your go-between to the spirit world to communicate with the dead and ancestral spirits or help you to recruit a multidimensional support team.&gt; Why you never need feel alone once you know you belong to the kinship of nature.&gt; Crystals, colors, and physical energy centers that correspond to each Power Animal.</p><p>Lori Morrison is a best-selling author, inspirationalist, and mystic.

There is much about Mary and Joseph in their task of bringing up a Jesus; about John the Baptist; about Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalen; about Nicodemus; about people we meet only for a moment, like the man born blind and the owners of the drowned swine; and why the Pharisees, not only the worst of them but some of the best, would not accept Christ. &nbsp;Faith, doctrine, prayer, worship--all the content and consequences of Christian belief--rest on the person of Christ Jesus as recorded in the Gospels. In this classic study, Frank J. Sheed employs wide learning, theological sophistication, spiritual insight, and a lucid style to bring the reader to a personal encounter with the living Lord. &nbsp;Sheed had a distinguished career as a publisher, lecturer, street-corner evangelist, and popular writer. He and his wife Maisie Ward were the founders of the publishing house Sheed &amp; Ward.</p></p><p>F. J. Sheed was one of the best-known Catholic apologists of the 20th century. He and his wife, Masie, founded the Catholic publishing house of Sheed &amp; Ward.

Written by Ojibway educator and spiritual leader Edward Benton-Banai, and first published in 1988, <i>The Mishomis Book</i> draws from the traditional teachings of tribal elders to instruct young readers about Ojibway creation stories and legends, the origin and importance of the Ojibway family structure and clan system, the Midewiwin religion, the construction and use of the water drum and sweat lodge, and modern Ojibway history.<br>Written for readers from all cultures-but especially for Ojibway and Native youth-<i>The Mishomis Book</i> provides an introduction to Ojibway culture and an understanding of the sacred Midewiwin teachings, aiming to protect this knowledge by instilling its importance in a new generation.

More critically, however, the contemporary visual vocabulary around beauty and the body has been reinfused with new vitality and substance thanks to an increase in powerful images authored by an international community of Black photographers. <br>In a richly illustrated essay, Sargent opens up the conversation around the role of the Black body in the marketplace; the cross-pollination between art, fashion, and culture in constructing an image; and the institutional barriers that have historically been an impediment to Black photographers participating more fully in the fashion (and art) industries. <br><br>Fifteen artist portfolios feature the brightest contemporary fashion photographers, including Tyler Mitchell, the first Black photographer hired to shoot a cover story for American Vogue; Campbell Addy, founder of the Nii Agency and journal; and Nadine Ijewere, whose early series title, The Misrepresentation of Representation, says it all. Alongside a series of conversations between generations, their images and stories chart the history of inclusion, and exclusion, in the creation of the commercial Black image, while simultaneously proposing a brilliantly reenvisioned future. <br><br>Photographs by Photographs by Campbell Addy, Arielle Bobb-Willis, Micaiah Carter, Awol Erizku, Nadine Ijewere, Quil Lemons, Namsa Leuba, Renell Medrano, Tyler Mitchell, Jamal Nxedlana, Daniel Obasi, Ruth Ossai, Adrienne Raquel, Dana Scruggs, and Stephen Tayo<br> And including conversations with Shaniqwa Jarvis, Mickalene Thomas, and Deborah Willis</p><p><b>Antwaun Sargent</b> is an independent writer, curator, and critic whose work has been published in the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>New York Times</i>, <i>W</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, <i>VICE</i>, and various museum catalogues, among other publications.&#x201c;Systemic change is already afoot, with many of Sargent&#x2019;s chosen photographers expanding the scope of their work...

With a shocking title and breathtaking writing, Dick Gregory defined a genre and changed the way race was discussed in America.<br><br>Telling stories that range from his hardscrabble childhood in St. Louis to his pioneering early days as a comedian to his indefatigable activism alongside Medgar Evers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Gregory's memoir riveted readers in the sixties. In the years and decades to come, the stories and lessons became more relevant than ever, and the book attained the status of a classic.

The electric Santa Clauses wink at you from windows. You stop off at your best friend's house and look at his tree and give him a ball-point pen with his name on it. You reach into your shopping bag and give something to everybody there, even the ones you don't know. It doesn't matter that they don't have anything for you because it feels so good to be in a warm happy place where grownups are laughing. There are Daddies around. Your best friend's so happy and excited, standing there trying on all his new clothes. As you walk down the stairs you hear his mother say: "Boo, you forgot to say good-by to Richard, say good-by to Richard, Boo, and wish him a . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then you're out on the street again and some of the lights have gone out. You take the long way home, and Mister Ben, the grocer, says: "Merry Christmas, Richard," and you give him a present out of the shopping bag, and you smile at a wino and give him a nickel, and you even wave at Grimes, the mean cop. It's a good feeling. You don't want to get home too fast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And then you hit North Taylor, your street, and something catches your eye and you lift your head up and it's there in your window. Can't believe it. You start running and the only thing in the whole world you're mad about is that you can't run fast enough. For the first time in a long while the cracked orange door says: "Come on in, little man, you're home now," and there's a wreath and lights in the window and a tree in the kitchen near the coal closet and you hug your Momma, her face hot from the stove. Oh, Momma, I'm so glad you did it like this because ours is new, just for us, everybody else's tree been up all week long for other people to see, and, Momma, ours is up just for us. Momma, oh, Momma, you did it again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My beautiful Momma smiled at me like Miss America, and my brothers and sisters danced around that little kitchen with the round wooden table and the orange-crate chairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Go get the vanilla, Richard," said Momma, "Presley, peel some sweet potatoes. Go get the bread out the oven, Dolores. You get away from that duckling, Garland. Ronald, oh, Ronald, you be good now, stand over there with Pauline. Oh, Richard, my little man, did you see the ham Miz White from the Eat Shop sent by, and the bag of nuts from Mister Myers and the turkey from Miz King, and wouldn't you know, Mister Ben, he . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey, Momma, I know some rich people don't got this much, a ham, and a turkey, Momma. . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The Lord, He's always looking out for my boys, Richard, and this ain't all, the white folks'll be by here tomorrow to bring us more things."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Momma was so happy that Christmas, all the food folks brought us and Mister Ben giving us more credit, and Momma even talked the electric man into turning the lights on again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey, Momma, look here, got a present for Daddy. A cigarette lighter, Momma, there's even a place to scratch a name on it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What you scratch on it, Richard, Big Pres or Daddy?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Nothing, Momma. Might have to give Daddy's present to old Mister White from the Eat Shop again."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She turned away and when she turned back her eyes were wet. Then she smiled her Miss America smile and grabbed my shoulder. "Richard, my little man, if I show you something, you won't tell nobody, will you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What is it, Momma?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I got something for you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, Momma, you forgot, everything's under the tree."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"This is something special, just for you, Richard."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thanks, Momma, oh, thanks, how'd you know I wanted a wallet, Momma, a real wallet like men have?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Momma always gave each of us something special like that, something personal that wasn't under the tree, something we weren't supposed to tell the other kids about. It always came out, though. Garland and I'd be fighting and one of us would say, "Momma likes me better than you, look what she gave me," and we both found out the other got a secret present, too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I loved that wallet. First thing I did was fill out the address card. If I got hit by a car someone would know who I am. Then I put my dollars in it, just like men do. Ran outside that night and got on a streetcar and pulled out my wallet and handed the conductor a dollar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Got anything smaller, boy?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sure, Mister," I said and I pulled out my wallet again and took a dime out of the coin purse and snapped it shut and put the dollar back in the long pocket and closed the wallet and slipped it into my back pocket. Did the same thing on the way back home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did we eat that night! It seemed like all the days we went without food, no bread for the baloney and no baloney for the bread, all the times in the summer when there was no sugar for the Kool-Aid and no lemon for the lemonade and no ice at all were wiped away. Man, we're all right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After dinner I went out the back door and looked at the sky and told God how nobody ever ate like we ate that night, macaroni and cheese and ham and turkey and the old duckling's cooking in the oven for tomorrow. There's even whiskey, Momma said, for people who come by. Thanks, God, Momma's so happy and even the rats and roaches didn't come out tonight and the wind isn't blowing through the cracks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How'd you know I wanted a wallet, God? I wonder if all the rich people who get mink coats and electric trains got that one little thing nobody knew they wanted. You know, God, I'm kinda glad you were born in a manger. I wonder, God, if they had let Mary in the first place she stopped at, would you have remembered tonight? Oh, God, I'm scared. I wish I could die right now with the feeling I have because I know Momma's going to make me mad and I'm going to make her mad, and me and Presley's gonna fight. . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Richard, you get in here and put your coat on. Get in here or I'll whip you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See what I mean, God, there she goes already and I'm not even cold, I'm all wrapped up in You.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What's wrong, Richard? Why you look so strange?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You wouldn't understand, Momma."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I would, Richard, you tell me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, I came out to pray, Momma, way out here so they wouldn't hear me and laugh at me and call me a sissy. God's a good God, ain't He, Momma?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, Richard."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Momma, if I tell you something, would you laugh at me, would you say I'm crazy, would you say I was lying? Momma?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What is it, Richard?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I heard Him talk to me, Momma."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She put her arm around my shoulders and pulled me against her. "He talks to people, Richard, some people that are real special and good like you. Do me a favor, Richard?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sure, Momma."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Next time you talk to Him, ask Him to send Daddy home."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Let me stay up and look out the window with you, Momma."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Everybody's in bed, Richard."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"All my life, Momma, I wanted to stay up with you on Christmas Eve and look out that window with you, Momma. I won't laugh at you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What you mean, Richard?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're waiting on him, ain't you? I know, Momma, every Christmas Eve you take a bath and put on that perfume and those clothes from the rich white folks and get down there on your knees in front of that window looking for Daddy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Richard, you better get on to bed."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I know, Momma, that whiskey ain't for people coming by, that's for Daddy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Richard, you go on to bed and when he gets here I'll wake you up."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, Momma, I want to sit up with you . . . Momma?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, Richard?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I shoulda got a present for Mister White, 'cause I know Daddy's coming to get his this year."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were a lot of things I wanted to tell Momma that night while we sat and waited for Daddy, while we prayed on our knees, and dozed and hugged each other against the cold and jumped up like jacks every time we heard a noise on the street. But I never did. Sometimes I think she knew anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to say to her, Momma, you remember that day I came home and told you I was at Doctor Jackson's house? And how he liked me, Momma, and told me I'd be a good doctor? How he's going to help me learn to read, and how he told me when it gets too cold to study in my house I could come by his house? Remember that, Momma? It was a lie. I played all that day in a vacant lot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I guess she knew. She never pressed me for names when I told her about all the people who liked me, all the people I created in my mind, people to help poor folks. I couldn't believe God had made a world and hadn't put none of those people in it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I made up a schoolteacher that loved me, that taught me to read. A teacher that didn't put me in the idiot's seat or talk about you and your kind. She didn't yell at me when I came to school with my homework all wrinkled and damp. She understood when I told her it was too cold to study in the kitchen so I did my homework under the covers with a flashlight. Then I fell asleep. And one of the other five kids in bed must have peed on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'd go out and sweat and make five dollars. And I'd come home and say, Momma, Mister Green told me to bring this to you. Told me he liked you. Told me he wished he could raise his kids the way you're raising us. That wasn't true, Momma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember all those birthday parties I went to, Momma? Used to steal things from the ten-cent store and give the best presents. I'd come home and tell you how we played pillow kiss and post office and pin the tail on the donkey and how everybody liked me? That was a lie, Momma. One girl cried and ran away when she threw the pillow and it hit me. She opened her eyes and saw she was supposed to kiss me and she cried and ran away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And on my birthday, Momma, when I came home with that shopping bag full of presents and told you the kids in my class loved me so much they all got me things? That wasn't true. I stole all those little things from the ten-cent store and wrapped them up and put a different kid's name on each one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, Richard, if he don't show up this time . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He's comin', Momma, it's like you said. He got held up in traffic, the trains were full."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You know, Richard, your Daddy's a cook, he has to work on Christmas."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He'll be here, Momma, you go put those clothes back on."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember when those people came by and told you how dirty we were, how they didn�t want us playing with their kids or coming into their houses? They said we smelled so bad. I was six then, and Presley was almost eight. You cried all night, Momma, and then you told us to stay home until you could get us some new clothes. And you went and hid all the clothes we had. Momma, it was summertime and we couldn�t just lay there, crying and watching out the window at the kids play running tag, and rip and run, and get called in for their naps, and get called in for their dinners. And we looked all over for our clothes, down in the basement, in the coal closet, under the stove, and we couldn�t find them. And then we went through your things, Momma, and put on the dresses you never wore, the dresses the rich white folks gave you. And then we went outside to play. The people laughed at us when we went outside in your dresses, pointed and slapped their legs. We never played so good as we played that summer, with all those people watching us. When we came off the porch those Negro doctors and lawyers and teachers waiting to get into White�s Eat Shop across the street would nudge each other and turn their heads. And when the streetcar stopped on the corner, right in front of our house, the people would lean out the windows and stare. Presley and I would wave at them. We did it all that summer, and after a while nobody bothered us. Everybody got to know that the Gregory boys didn�t have clothes so they wore their mother�s dresses. We just made sure we were home before you got there, Momma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How do I look, Richard?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You look okay, Momma."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"These are the best pair of shoes I got, Miz Wallace gave me them, but they're summer shoes."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What you mean, summer shoes? Those are the black and white ones I like so much, the ones you never wear. I didn't know they were summer shoes."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You never see folks wear white shoes in the wintertime."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"People dye them, Momma. I'll dye them for you so you can put them on and Daddy can see you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, Richard, there won't be time, they got to dry."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't worry, Momma, you burn the dye and it dries right while you wear it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I've dyed a lot of shoes, Momma, down on my hands and knees in the taverns, dyeing shoes and shining shoes. I never told you too much about the things I did and the things I saw. Momma, remember the time I came home with my teeth knocked in and my lip all cut? Told you I tripped downstairs. Momma, I got kicked. Right in the face.</p></p><h2>Sewing Clothes for Barbie: 24 Stylish Outfits for Fashion Dolls</h2><p><b>Sew Barbie this cute wardrobe of 24 stylish outfits.

But these stories aren't sedate, scholarly works. They're action-packed, fast-paced, high-drama adventures, with monsters, romance, and not a few huge explosions. O'Connor's vibrant, kinetic art brings ancient tales to undeniable life, in a perfect fusion of super-hero aesthetics and ancient Greek mythology. </p><p>Volume 1 of OLYMPIANS, ZEUS: King OF THE GODS, introduces readers to the ruler of the Olympian Pantheon, telling his story from his boyhood to his ascendance to supreme power. This title has Common Core connections.</p></p><p><b>George O'Connor</b> is an author, illustrator and cartoonist. His first graphic novel, <i>Journey Into Mohawk Country</i>, used as its sole text the actual historical journal of the seventeenth-century Dutch trader Harmen Meyndertsz van den Bogaert, and told the true story of how New York almost wasn't. He followed that up with <i>Ball Peen Hammer</i>, the first graphic novel written by playwright Adam Rapp, a dark, dystopian view of a society's collapse. Now he has brought his attention to Olympians, an ongoing series retelling the classic Greek myths in comics form. In addition to his graphic novel career, O'Connor has published several children's picture books, including the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling <i>Kapow</i>, <i>Sally and the Some-Thing</i>, and <i>Uncle Bigfoot</i>. He lives in Brooklyn, NY.<p>&#x201c;O'Connor unveils his new Olympians graphic-novel series with this story of the daddy of Greek gods. Most immediately striking about this, aside from the exciting artwork, is the care O'Connor takes to visualize the creation myth that begins with Gaea creating and taking as a husband the sky, Ouranos. Their children-the Titans and other proto-Olympian entities-are often neglected or at best murkily covered, but here they're vividly portrayed with all the magnificence of their beyond-good-and-evil power. After this breathtaking and lengthy sequence, Zeus enters the scene to grow from a feisty nymph-needling youth to a lightning bolt-wielding avenger. The extended, earth-shattering battle he wages with his father, Kronos, takes up the bulk of the story, delivering page after page of cataclysmic blows with the sensibility and hyperkinetic pacing of a literary superhero comic. While O'Connor includes a generous bounty of bonus materials to gratify myth hounds, this series could well become the initiation point for a new cadre of acolytes. New volumes should come quickly, with Athena's book due in April 2010.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;O'Connor (Kapow!; Journey into Mohawk Country) embarks on a new project: a series of graphic novels for young readers about Greek mythology (Athena: Grey-Eyed Goddess follows in April, with Hera and Hades in the pipeline). While the D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths is the gold standard for illustrated introductions to Greek mythology, O'Connor offers a modern take with a new view of these "original superhero stories" with gritty yet heroic art and spare prose that lets the myths speak for themselves. The story is the one most schoolchildren know-the Titans created Zeus and Hera, as well as the Cyclopes, and adventure ensued-but O'Connor brings the young gods to life with memorable compositions and attention to detail (childlike fear on Hera's face as she navigates the treacherous new world, a bat screeching away as Zeus confronts the Cyclopes). Back matter includes notes, a bibliography, a list of recommended books for further reading, and discussion questions for readers, making it attractive for teachers and librarians for its information and depth of research. But that shouldn't stop tweens from enjoying the story. Ages 9-12. (Jan.)&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;An energetic graphic series on classical mythology debuts with the origin story of the Big Cheese Olympian, Zeus. Appropriately heightened, stately language narrates the joining of Gaea with Ouranos, the Titans' rise to power and Kronos's devouring of all his children but one-Zeus (pictured with lots of muscles and, oddly enough, Nordic blond good looks). In contrast (and in the same spirit as G. Brian Karas's rendition of the King of the Gods's story for younger readers, Young Zeus, also 2009), speech-balloon dialogue is decidedly colloquial: "Hey Metis. How about a kiss?" O'Connor pulls out the comic-book stops in his artwork, consciously echoing superteam portraits of yore in his line-up of angry Olympians and allowing the Clash of the Titans to extend over pages and pages of hugely satisfying sound effects, crumbled mountains and thrown lighting bolts. He plants clues in both text and images to stories to be developed as the series continues. Extensive backmatter includes an author's note, full-page character profiles, "G[r]eek Notes," discussion questions ("Has your dad ever tried to eat you?") and a bibliography. Holy Cyclopes, here's a keeper. (Graphic mythology. 8-14)&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Here it is! The book you've been waiting for: the first in a 12-book graphic novel series about the Greek gods, called Olympians. And it's just in time to satiate the kids waiting anxiously for The Lightning Thief's movie release (and aimed at the same age readers). Going back to sources from antiquity, including Homer and Hesiod, George O'Connor begins his story with the creation of the gods and lays the foundation for their famous jealousies and rash actions. For starters, Ouranos (the sky), husband to Gaea (Mother Earth), favors his Titan offspring ("They were ageless and beautiful and so tall that their heads scraped the sky") over the one-eyed Cyclopes and Hekatonchieres (each of which has 50 heads and 100 hands). So Ouranos condemns the latter two lines to a chasm deep within the earth. Gaea (pronounced GHEE-uh), however, wants all of her children to be free. So, at her urging and with Kronos in the lead, the Titans "cut open the sky" and drain Ouranos of power. Much to Gaea's dismay, Kronos, now ruler of the Titans, "has too much of his father in him," and he, too, refuses to free his brothers below the earth. So she appeals to the next generation--Zeus.</p><p>O'Connor, who early on demonstrated his love of comics with his debut picture book, Kapow!, taps into the more complex visual characterizations he explored in his artwork for last fall's Ball Peen Hammer (by Adam Rapp) here. Kronos and Zeus, even at their most chilling, never lose their dimension or their charisma. The artist uses long vertical cartoon panels in wine, rust and midnight-blue tones to emphasize the commanding grace of the Titans, as well as the "new life" that arises from the drops of Ouranos's blood (and the text plants seeds to further installments: "What came from that [pink froth] is a tale for another day"). The first sight of a maturing Zeus warrants a full page and a much lighter palette in terra cotta, forest green and robin's egg blue. Eight equal panels chronicle Zeus's transformation into an eagle ("To be an Olympian... was to be able to change shape as others change their mind"), and when Zeus meets Metis (a daughter to Oceanus and future mother of Athena), the story shifts from the omniscient narrator's voice to direct dialogue between the pair. But the climactic duel between Kronos and Zeus (father and son) is O'Connor's crowning achievement here. While carefully adhering to the Greek legends, O'Connor endows these mythic characters with a freshness and magnetism that will attract even today's visually savvy youth.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gr 4 Up-This 12-volume series debuts with the origins of Zeus. O'Connor begins his retelling by starting from literally nothing. Then a simple brown circle introduces readers to Gaea, or Mother Earth. The creation of Olympians unfolds slowly with simple straightforward lines and silhouettes. Dark browns and blacks echo the early development of the Titans. The first fully rendered face is that of the infant Zeus, with his birth symbolized in a pastel palette. This new race of Gods is visually and strikingly different. Zeus's virility and vitality both bring the story to life and make it accessible to young readers. Zeus's encounters with gods, particularly his battle with his father Kronos, are visually compelling. Images of grasping hands, thunderbolts, close-up visages, gaping holes in the earth, and silhouetted bodies bring Zeus's struggle for dominance into clear focus. Oversize panels reinforce the heroic proportions of the story. It is telling that from such a simple beginning, the complex story is able to evolve naturally to a satisfying conclusion, as depicted on the final page showing Zeus and the new race of numerous immortal gods. O'Connor clearly hints throughout the retelling that more stories are forthcoming: "And that is a tale for another day." Endpapers show the Olympian Family Tree. Back matter includes an author's note, notation of Greek words, discussion questions, and recommended reading. This ultimate superhero story will appeal to anyone who enjoys Greek mythology or great comic art.&#x201d; &#x2015;Barbara M. Moon, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY, <i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Readers who find Edith Hamilton-styled myth retellings just a tad too stately or a touch too solemn will be delighted with this debut title in the Olympians series of graphic novels. O'Connor takes his subject seriously, adhering closely to Hesiod's <i>Theogony; </i>he ramps it up with artwork that retains the majesty of a creation story while sparkling with dashes of comic-book humor that nestle readers right into a comfort zone. Beginning with Gaea's creation of her heavenly mate, Ouranos, he launches into the epically dysfunctional family drama that is the story of their belligerent offspring. These ur-creatures, regal and monumental, seem to be chiseled out of elemental earth itself, but teens who are immersed, or even slightly dipped, in contemporary comics will also recognize that carefully staged group poses of the Titans and Kronos' six children recall superhero teams mustering their forces to kick some cosmic butt. It's this balance between respect for myth and adherence to comic-book form that works so wonderfully well here: Zeus is every inch the ripped stud, equally adept at warfare and womanizing; Metis, who helps him conquer his child-consuming father, is a not-as-ditzy-as-she-looks blonde; and Hera, Zeus' sister and wife, is both a vulnerable rescued maiden and a no-nonsense queen. O'Connor packs his title with delicious end matter, including full-page summaries of several main figures, in presentations reminiscent of game-character bios; a note on oral and written transmission of Greek myths; "G[r]eek Notes" that explicate the contents of various panels (and sometimes provide tie-ins with contemporary comic book heroes); a bibliography and list of recommended reading; discussion questions; and an Olympians Family Tree that graces the front endpaper.

Paj Ntaub and her family move to their house in the summer, when her mother's belly is round with twins, and the garden is flourishing. Across the street live Ruth and Bob, an elderly couple with whom they exchange friendly waves. The seasons change, twins are born, and Ruth dies. To comfort Bob, Paj Ntaub makes a chalk drawing on his driveway that features elements from her year and nods to the story cloth her family keeps that commemorates their journey to America. Although readers see the story cloth on the wall and at the end, what it details is never really<br>explained, though a brief note on the copyright page describes what it is. This is more of a relationship story, showing how Paj Ntaub engages with her brothers and grandmother and how neighboring families come together when sadness strikes. <strong>Kim's digital artwork using pastels, graphite, watercolors, and hand-scanned textures captures the warmth of family, the charm of changing seasons, and the depth of friendships.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"A young Hmong girl settles into her new home, and as the seasons change, so does the world around her. <em>A Map Into the World</em> is a beautiful and hopeful story about love and loss, family and friendship, and it belongs in every reader's hands."&#x2015;Sarah Park Dahlen, Associate Professor in the MLIS Program at St. Catherine University</p> (<i>Other Print</i>)<br><br><p>"With the clear, careful, and beautiful language we've come to expect from her, Kao Kalia Yang unfurls her first children's book, a journey waiting to reward our every step.

These neighbors--Bob and Ruth--routinely sit outside on their 'special bench.' They assume their perch throughout autumn, but come winter they stay indoors. One morning Paj Ntaub notices cars parked in front of the couple's house, and her father tells her that Ruth has died.<br>"When spring arrives, Paj Ntaub sees Bob sitting alone on the bench. Paj Ntaub has an idea. With Bob's permission, she does a chalk drawing in his driveway: 'I started my picture with a teardrop./ And then I made it splatter like sunshine.' She festoons the asphalt with neighborhood sights--gingko leaf, worm--and tells Bob that she has created 'a map into the world. Just in case you need it.'<br>Kao Kalia Yang, author of the much-praised adult titles <em>The Latehomecomer: A Hmong Family Memoir</em> and <em>The Song Poet: A Memoir of My Father</em>, has written<strong> a quietly uplifting picture book. </strong><em>A Map into the World</em> suggests that when a family's equilibrium is upset (by a death, by a move), the neighborhood family (in all its ethnic variety) can help restore it. Illustrator Seo Kim realizes the book's largely outdoor setting: she individuates the veins on leaves; tree bark is invitingly ridged. In a breathtaking touch, Paj Ntaub's Hmong grandmother's 'special story cloth'--too small for readers to appreciate as it appears within the story--fills the book's endpapers. --Nell Beram, freelance writer and YA author<br>Discover: This handsomely composed picture book spotlights a friendship between an elderly white couple and a Hmong American child who moves into the neighborhood."&#x2015;<em>Shelf Awareness</em></p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"In <em>A Map into the World</em>, narrated by a shy little girl named Paj Ntaub, a Hmong American family moves into a house across the street from an elderly couple named Bob and Ruth, who befriend them. Through the eyes of Paj Ntaub, we experience the quiet joys of gardening, family life, and the change of seasons. After Ruth dies, Bob is overcome with sorrow. Paj Ntaub decides to comfort him with a chalk drawing of the world as she knows it, a world filled with wonder and sorrow and happiness. There is a timeless, familiar quality to Kao Kalia Yang's lovely, gentle picture book that will keep readers young and old returning to these pages again and again."&#x2015;Alison McGhee, #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Someday</em></p> (<i>Other Print</i>)<br><br><p>"A young Hmong American girl shares the small things of wonder that make up her world. When Paj Ntaub moves into a new green house with big windows with her family, the garden grows with 'tomatoes, green beans, and a watermelon as round as my mother's belly.' Soon, the green house becomes their house. Paj Ntaub helps 'Tais Tais hang the special story cloth about how the Hmong got to America.' She exchanges waves with her neighbors Bob and Ruth, an elderly white couple even older than Tais Tais. And changing seasons usher in life and death. In gentle prose, Yang's picture-book debut explores nature, community, and connection. Twin brothers are born amid the summer bounty in the garden. On a snowy, cold morning, loss arrives, and bare gingko trees '[reach] for the sky with their thin fingers' against the new emptiness of the house across the street. When the world becomes green again, Paj Ntaub draws together these connections in a neighborly gesture of comfort. Using digital graphite, pastels, watercolor, and scanned handmade textures, Kim brings detailed dimension to the green house and the world around it. Alternating perspectives capture the expansiveness of the outside as well as the intimacy of Paj Ntaub's observations. <strong>Contemplative, curious, and kind.</strong>"&#x2015;starred, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Yang (<em>The Song Poet</em> for adults), a Hmong writer making her picture book debut, offers a story about a girl who notices things. Young Paj Ntaub (both a girl's name and a term that nods to needlework tellings of Hmong experiences) moves with her family to a green house and helps to hang their story cloth 'about how the Hmong got to America' on the wall. When her twin baby brothers cry too loudly, her father takes her outside, where they wave to their elderly neighbors, Bob and Ruth. In lovingly detailed spreads, Kim, making her U.S. debut, draws all the things that Paj Ntaub sees: gingko leaves ('yellow like apricots'), winter snow, a worm. When Ruth dies in the winter, and Paj Ntaub notices Bob grieving come spring, she chalks a wealth of previously regarded details on his driveway&#x2015;'a map into the world,' she explains. Though age separates them, Paj Ntaub's accounting of everyday details reaches Bob&#x2015;and gives voice to the child's experience, too. <strong>A distinctive story that weaves together threads of family life, community and culture, the natural world, and the power of stories.</strong>"&#x2015;starred, <em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Full of heart. And hope. This is exactly the kind of book I want to read to my daughter, and I wish I could hand a copy to every kid.

New babies at home bring a big change, but there's a big change at the neighbors', too, after Ruth dies in the fall. When spring comes again, though, Paj Ntaub sees Bob outside again, and she uses her sidewalk chalk to draw him a beautiful picture that maps him a way back to the world. Jacket copy suggests that this is biographically based; it's a sensitive yet well-controlled exploration of a child's early experience with loss and condolence, and it's realistic that Paj Ntaub's life doesn't focus entirely on Bob and Ruth but her neighbors remain significant in her literal and emotional landscape. The digital art is a textural delight, with grainy planes of color contrasting with trim black lines and the abundant botanicals of the garden. Touches of Hmong tradition in the family's wall hanging and in our heroine's artistic creation add depth to the story (a brief glossary/pronunciation guide for Hmong words appears on the copyright page). <strong>A gentle, subtle introduction to life's changes and seasons, this comfortingly allows kids to approach difficult topics from a safe distance.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>Etched in Sand: A True Story of Five Siblings Who Survived an Unspeakable Childhood on Long Island</h2><p><p><strong>#1 International Bestseller</strong></p><p>Regina&#x2019;s Calcaterra memoir, <em>Etched in Sand</em>, is an inspiring and triumphant coming-of-age story of tenacity and hope.<br>&nbsp;<br>Regina Calcaterra is a successful lawyer, former New York State official, and foster youth activist.

His lasting fame derives from his writings on Stoic ideology, in which philosophy is a practical form of self-improvement rather than a matter of argument or wordplay. Seneca's letters to a young friend advise action rather than reflection, addressing the issues that confront every generation: how to achieve a good life; how to avoid corruption and self-indulgence; and how to live without fear of death. <br>Written in an intimate, conversational style, the letters reflect the traditional Stoic focus on living in accordance with nature and accepting the world on its own terms. The philosopher emphasizes the Roman values of courage, self-control, and rationality, yet he remains remarkably modern in his tolerant and cosmopolitan attitude. Rich in epigrammatic wit, Seneca's interpretation of Stoicism constitutes a timeless and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind.</p><p>Lucius Annaeus Seneca (4 B.C&#x2013;A.D. 65) was a Roman statesman, Stoic philosopher, and dramatist.

More than 200 images of industry, agriculture, architecture, and nature highlight incredible patterns while also revealing a deeper story about human impact. This extraordinary photographic journey around our planet captures the sense of wonder gained from a new, aerial vantage point and creates a perspective of Earth as it has never been seen before.</p><p><i>Overview </i>takes its inspiration from Daily Overview&#x2014;an Instagram project established by author BENJAMIN GRANT. Since he began the project in December 2013, his daily posts have both delighted and challenged his audience from all corners of the globe. For <i>Overview</i>, Grant has curated and created more than 200 original images by stitching together numerous high-resolution satellite photographs. With each Overview, Grant aims to not only inspire a fresh perspective of our planet but also encourage a new understanding of what human impact looks like. He lives and rides his bike in New York City.INTRODUCTION&nbsp;<br><br>This all began with an accident. I was preparing for a meeting of a space club that I started and since the upcoming talk was focused on satellites and how they affect our daily lives, I was playing around on a mapping program. I typed &#x201c;Earth&#x201d; into the search bar to see if it would zoom out to show the entire planet. When I pressed enter, to my surprise, it did the opposite of what I hoped for, and zoomed in.&nbsp;<br><br>The map had indeed settled on Earth&#x2014;Earth, Texas. I was astounded by what I saw. My screen had filled with a stunning patchwork of green and brown circles. I saved the image (seen here on the left) and showed it to my friends; they, too, were amazed. It turns out my entire screen contained pivot irrigation fields, created by sprinklers that water crops in a circular pattern.&nbsp;<br><br>A few months before I discovered Earth in Texas, a friend shared a short film with me called <i>Overview</i>. The film introduced me to the idea of the &#x201c;Overview Effect&#x201d;&#x2014;an idea that changed the way I see our planet and its place in the universe. Coined by Frank White in 1987, the &#x201c;Overview Effect&#x201d; refers to the profound emotional sensation that astronauts experience when given the opportunity to look down at Earth from space. From a distant vantage point, one has the chance to appreciate our home as a whole, to reflect on its beauty and its fragility all at once.&nbsp;<br><br>The anecdotes of the astronauts in the film inspired the map search for &#x201c;Earth&#x201d; that fortuitously led me astray a few months later. They also helped me realize that there needs to be a dramatic shift in the way our species views our planet before we can truly understand the full extent of our impact. As inspirational as this idea was, I had no clue how I, or anyone for that matter, could make that shift happen. For me, everything changed once I saw those crop circles.</p><h2>The Mental Game of Poker: Proven Strategies for Improving Tilt Control, Confidence, Motivation, Coping with Variance, and More</h2><p>The mental game may be more important in poker than in any other form of competition.

These include rapid changes in the dynamics of global politics, world leadership and terror attacks across Europe.</p><p>Douglas Murray travels across Europe to examine first-hand how mass immigration, cultivated self-distrust and delusion have contributed to a continent in the grips of its own demise. From the shores of Lampedusa to migrant camps in Greece, from Cologne to London, he looks critically at the factors that have come together to make Europeans unable to argue for themselves and incapable of resisting their alteration as a society. Murray's "tremendous and shattering" book (<i>The Times</i>) addresses the disappointing failures of multiculturalism, Angela Merkel's U-turn on migration, the lack of repatriation and the Western fixation on guilt, uncovering the malaise at the very heart of the European culture. His conclusion is bleak, but the predictions not irrevocable. As Murray argues, this may be our last chance to change the outcome, before it's too late.</p></p><p><b>Douglas Murray</b> is Associate Editor of the <i>Spectator </i>and writes frequently for a variety of other publications, including the <i>Sunday Times, Standpoint</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.

A quick peek into any gym will bear witness to how well stocked and versatile training facilities have become in recognition of the importance of strength and stamina in any fitness program. Sporting performance is improved, like most things in life, with repetition and practice. But the human body's musculature is complex, so the question is: what exercises should you be doing and what is best practice for your particular sport? <i>Encyclopedia of Exercise Anatomy</i> is designed to answer that question. Whether you're a novice at tennis picking up the racquet for the first time, or a seasoned rugby player wishing to brush up on strengthening the particular muscles that provide much needed power in the scrum, this is the book for you. </p><p> Part 1 of the book includes detailed anatomical illustrations highlighting all the major muscles in the upper body and all the major muscles of the lower body. Don't worry, you don't need to learn all the anatomical terminology, but the information is there for you to refer back to at any time. The more you work out, the more you will begin to understand about the way the human body works -- and that can only be a good thing when your ambition is to achieve peak fitness. </p><p> Part 2 introduces over 100 exercises divided into four sections: upper body exercises, lower body exercises, core exercises and stretches. There is an in-depth guide for each exercise, including the muscle groups used, step-by-step instructions and pertinent performance tips. Once again, anatomical illustrations highlight the key muscle groups involved in the exercise and annotation identifies the individual muscles being worked. </p><p> Part 3 of the book combines the individual exercises into highly effective programs. This section is divided into two subsections: the first dealing with fifty popular sports; the second dealing with functional workouts for specific non-sporting activities. </p><p> Following a brief overview of each sport and the muscles called into play, the sports programs are organised into three levels of intensity to meet the demands of every athlete, from beginner to advanced, and to provide those all-important goals to work towards -- whatever your level of fitness. An alternative set of programs is provided to add interest and variety to your workout. </p><p> The remaining programs in the book focus on real-world scenarios such as workouts to help back or knee problems. This final exercise section also helps you target specific body areas that you want to enhance for purely aesthetic reasons, whether you're looking to build bigger, more powerful arms or sculpting a glorious derriere. As with the sport-specific section, there is an introductory paragraph that gives a brief overview of the muscles used; the exercise programs themselves are set at three different levels of intensity -- in most cases an alternative program is provided for variety. </p></p><h2>Transforming Discipleship</h2><p>Many church leaders, yearning for church growth, look to the latest evangelistic strategies or seeker-targeted worship services. But lack of growth might not be due to lack of concern for new people&#x2015;it may be because we are not effectively discipling the people we already have. Greg Ogden address the need for discipleship in the local church and recovers Jesus' method of accomplishing life change by investing in just a few people at a time. Ogden sets forth his vision for transforming both the individual disciple and discipleship itself, showing how discipleship can become a self-replicating process with ongoing impact from generation to generation. This revised and updated edition includes a new chapter on discipleship and preaching.</p><p>Greg Ogden (DMin, Fuller Theological Seminary) recently retired as executive pastor of discipleship at Christ Church of Oak Brook. Prior to that he served as director of the doctor of ministry program at Fuller Theological Seminary. Now based in Monterey, California, he lives out his passion of teaching about the disciple-making mission of the church."I found Greg Ogden when I was searching for what God wanted me to do to follow his call to raise up disciples in a maximum security prison. His book <em>Transforming Discipleship</em> has been our guidebook as God has created 'hot houses of the Holy Spirit' throughout our prison. Hundreds of men's lives have been and continue to be changed through the path shown in this book." (Craig Brubaker, volunteer chaplain, Texas Department of Criminal Justice)<br><br>"This is one of the foremost books written on biblical discipleship (practically, philosophically, and theologically) in the last fifty years! Why? It is founded on God's Word, with a extensive focus on how Jesus, the ultimate disciple maker, equipped his apostles to multiply and change the world! Greg writes brilliantly and clearly and also shares from his own experiences in pouring his life into a few. If you are curious or have a passion to impact others for God's glory by following Jesus' method of investing in a few, read this book." (Monte Starkes, director, Life on Life and Global Outreach, Perimeter Church)<br><br>"No one gets the why and how of transforming ordinary people into extraordinary disciples like Greg Ogden does. As someone who worked alongside of him for ten years, I know that disciple making isn't a theory for Greg, but a way of life. In this revised edition of his landmark book, Greg offers individuals and churches an invaluable manual for shaping circles and cultures that are truly transformative in the way that Jesus and Paul originally had in mind." (Daniel Meyer, senior pastor, Christ Church of Oak Brook, host, Life Focus Television, author of Witness Essentials, coauthor of Leadership Essentials)<br><br>"Greg Ogden nails it again. This revised and expanded version of his how-to and why-to disciple-making manifesto will continue to be a real asset to the modern church. The lost art of disciple making requires this fresh appraisal and application for the current generation in light of the extensive popularity of program-driven growth strategies. Greg's book is a well-balanced, timely, and practical tool for pastors and lay leaders alike who want to embrace both the message and the method of Jesus Christ for reaching the world through intentional multiplication." (Christopher Moody, pastor, professor, Liberty University School of Divinity)<br><br>"Not only inspiring but compelling for all Christian leaders who are desperately searching for answers to the urgent question of how we can create a reproducible hothouse for discipleship and genuine spiritual transformation. If I could only have room for a handful of discipleship books on my shelf, this would definitely be one of them! It's a book I will keep reading over and over to mine its contents fully. Kudos to you, Greg, for writing an even deeper and richer next edition!" (Mary Schaller, president, Q Place, author of The 9 Arts of Spiritual Conversations)<br><br>"Greg has relentlessly grappled with what it means to be Jesus' disciple and what it means to obey Jesus' command to 'make disciples of all nations.' This book is the fruit of that grappling. And, oh, what delicious fruit it is! What Greg writes is simultaneously convicting (the fact is, we are not doing the work) and encouraging (actually, if we just follow the Master's method, we can do the work!). The unique contribution Greg makes, besides his thorough reading of Scripture and other committed disciple makers, is that he has actually practiced what he is preaching! Countless people&#x2015;many of whom he has never met&#x2015;have been transformed into authentic followers of Jesus through implementing the vision Greg has lived and lays before us. If the rest of us would-be disciple makers will join Greg . . . look out, world!" (Darrell W. Johnson, director, Centre of Preaching, Carey Theological College, Vancouver, author of The Glory of Preaching)<br><br>"<em>Transforming Discipleship</em> is truly transforming. This book brings out the importance of discipleship and illustrates the processes of healthy, reproducible methods of disciple making. Deep biblical insight compels and challenges us to go back to the practice Jesus established." (Pradeep Jha, president, Tabernacle Ministries)<br><br>"Greg Ogden's lifelong passion for growing true disciples culminates in his outstanding <em>Transforming Discipleship</em>. In our day, in which congregations know their church programs are no longer as fruitful in growing disciples, Greg gives a solid foundation for developing discipleship based on the ministry of Jesus. He offers wonderful counsel in the use of what he calls 'microgroups,' a church-based strategy for making disciples. I can't wait to put this book into the hands of countless pastors and congregations looking for biblically grounded practices that actually grow disciples." (E. Stanley Ott, founder and president, Vital Churches Institute)<br><br>"Greg's genius in <em>Transforming Discipleship</em> is that he calls the church back to making disciples a few at a time. Jesus chose twelve men to disciple&#x2015;three in particular. Why, then, don't we see discipleship groups of three and four filling our churches and serving in our communities? Greg addresses this problem and lays out a brilliantly biblical solution: start making disciples a few at a time! It's a must-read for every pastor&#x2015;indeed for all followers of Christ. The revised and expanded edition is fantastic&#x2015;especially chapter ten, in which Greg emphasizes the importance of proclaiming a gospel that leads to discipleship." (Ben Sobels, senior pastor, Cypress Community Church, Salinas, California)<br><br>"No book has influenced my understanding of discipleship group dynamics and multiplication more than <em>Transforming Discipleship</em>. Through years of research, field-testing, group implementation, and individual feedback, Greg offers a proven, timeless method for making disciples who will make even more disciples. Every pastor, church leader, and follower of Christ should read this book and apply the principles it teaches." (Robby Gallaty, pastor, Long Hollow Baptist Church, author of Rediscovering Discipleship)</p><h2>The Love Season: A Novel</h2><p><p>It's a hot August Saturday on Nantucket Island. Over the course of the next 24 hours, two lives will be transformed forever.</p><p>Marguerite Beale, former chef of culinary hot spot Les Parapluies, has been out of the public eye for over a decade. This all changes with a phone call from Marguerite's goddaughter, Renata Knox. Marguerite has not seen Renata since the death of Renata's mother, Candace Harris Knox, fourteen years earlier. And now that Renata is on Nantucket visiting the family of her new fianc�, she takes the opportunity, against her father's wishes, to contact Marguerite in hopes of learning the story of her mother's life&#x2015;and death. But the events of the day spiral hopelessly out of control for both women, and nothing ends up as planned.</p><p>Welcome to <i>The Love Season</i>&#x2015;a riveting story that takes place in one day and spans decades; a story that embraces the charming, pristine island of Nantucket, as well as Manhattan, Paris and Morocco. Elin Hilderbrand's most ambitious novel to date chronicles the famous couplings of real lives: love and friendship, food and wine, deception and betrayal&#x2015;and forgiveness and healing.</p></p><p><b>Elin Hilderbrand</b> is the author of <i>The Island</i>, <i>Nantucket Nights</i>, <i>Summer People</i> and <i>The Blue Bistro</i>, among others. She grew up in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, where she was a teaching/writing fellow. Her short fiction has appeared in <i>Seventeen</i>, <i>The Massachusetts Review</i>, and <i>The Colorado Review</i>. She lives with her husband, Chip Cunningham, and their two sons in Nantucket, Massachusetts.<p><strong>Chapter One</strong><br>August 19, 2006 � 6:30 a.m.<br><br>Marguerite didn&#x2019;t know where to start. <br><br>Each and every summer evening for nearly twenty years, she had cooked for a restaurant full of people, yet here she was in her own kitchen on a crystalline morning with a seemingly simple mission--dinner for two that evening at seven thirty--and she didn&#x2019;t know where to start. Her mind spun like the pedals of a bicycle without any brakes. Candace coming here, after all these years. Immediately Marguerite corrected herself. Not Candace. Candace was dead. Renata was coming tonight. The baby.<br><br>Marguerite&#x2019;s hands quivered as she brought her coffee mug to her lips. The grandfather clock chimed just as it had every fifteen minutes of its distinguished life--but this time, the sound startled Marguerite. She pictured a monkey inside, with two small cymbals and a voice screeching, Marguerite! Earth to Marguerite!<br><br>Marguerite chuckled. I am an old bat, she thought. I&#x2019;ll start by writing a list.<br><br>The phone call had come at eleven o&#x2019;clock the night before. Marguerite was in bed, reading Hemingway. Whereas once Marguerite had been obsessed with food--with heirloom tomatoes and lamb shanks and farmhouse cheeses, and fish still flopping on the counter, and eggs and chocolate and black truffles and foie gras and rare white nectarines--now the only thing that gave her genuine pleasure was reading. The people of Nantucket wondered--oh yes, she knew they wondered--what Marguerite did all day, hermited in her house on Quince Street, secreted away from the eyes of the curious. Although there was always something--the laundry, the garden, the articles for the newspaper in Calgary (deadline every other Friday)--the answer was: reading. Marguerite had three books going at any one time. That was the chef in her, the proverbial more-than-one-pot-on-the-stove. She read contemporary fiction in the mornings, though she was very picky. She liked Philip Roth, Penelope Lively, as a rule no one under the age of fifty, for what could they possibly have to say about the world that Marguerite hadn&#x2019;t already learned? In the afternoons, she enriched herself with biographies or books of European history, if they weren&#x2019;t too dense. Her evenings were reserved for the classics, and when the phone rang the night before Marguerite had been reading Hemingway. Hemingway was the perfect choice for late at night because his sentences were clear and easy to understand, though Marguerite stopped every few pages and asked herself, Is that all he means? Might he mean something else? This insecurity was a result of attending the Culinary Institute instead of a proper university--and all those years with Porter didn&#x2019;t help. An education makes you good company for yourself, Porter had liked to tell his students, and Marguerite, when he was trying to convince her to read something other than Larousse Gastronomique. Wouldn&#x2019;t he be proud of her now.<br><br>The phone, much like the muted toll of the clock a few seconds ago, had scared Marguerite out of her wits. She gasped, and her book slid off her lap to the floor, where it lay with its pages folded unnaturally under, like a person with a broken limb. The phone, a rotary, continued its cranky, mechanical whine while Marguerite groped her nightstand for her watch. Eleven o&#x2019;clock. Marguerite could name on one hand the phone calls she&#x2019;d received in the past twelve months: There was a call or two from the editorial assistant at the Calgary paper; there was a call from the Culinary Institute each spring asking for a donation; there was always a call from Porter on November 3, her birthday. None of these people would ever think to call her at eleven o&#x2019;clock at night--not even Porter, drunk (not even if he&#x2019;d split from the nubile young graduate assistant who had become his late-in-life wife), would dare call Marguerite at this hour. So it was a wrong number. Marguerite decided to let it ring. She had no answering machine to put the phone out of its misery; it just rang and rang, as pleading and insistent as a crying baby. Marguerite picked it up, clearing her throat first. She occasionally went a week without speaking.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aunt Daisy?&#x201d; The voice had been light and cheerful; there was background noise--people talking, jazz music, the familiar clink and clatter of glasses and plates--was it restaurant noise? It threw Marguerite off. And then there was the nickname: Daisy. Only three people had ever used it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Renata.&#x201d; There was an expectant pause. &#x201c;Renata Knox.&#x201d;<br><br>Marguerite&#x2019;s eyes landed across the room, on her desk. Taped to her computer was Renata Knox&#x2019;s e-mail address; Marguerite beheld it every day as she binged guiltily on the Internet for an hour, but she had never sent a single message. Because what could she possibly say? A casual hello would be pointless and anything more, dangerous. Marguerite&#x2019;s eyes skittered from her desk to her dresser. On top of her dresser were two precious framed photographs. She dusted them carefully each week, though she rarely lingered over them anymore. Years ago she had scrutinized them so intensely that they imprinted themselves on her brain. She knew them by heart, the way she knew the streets in the sixth arrondissement, the way she knew the temperament of a souffl�. One picture was of Marguerite and Candace taken at Les Parapluies on the occasion of Renata&#x2019;s christening. In it, Marguerite was holding Renata, her goddaughter. How well she remembered that moment. It had taken a magnum of Veuve Clicquot and several glasses of thirty-year port to get Dan to relinquish his grip on his newborn daughter, and when he did, it was only to Candace so that the baby could nurse. Marguerite sat with Candace on the west banquette as the party thundered around them. Marguerite knew little of babies, or lactation; she fed people every day, but nothing was as captivating as watching Candace feed her daughter. When Candace finished, she eased the baby up over her shoulder until the baby burped. Then Candace passed her over to Marguerite casually, like she was a loaf of bread.<br><br>Go see your godmother, Candace said to the baby.<br><br>Godmother, Marguerite had thought. The last time she had been inside a church before that very morning was for Candace and Dan&#x2019;s wedding, and before that the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris the year she met Porter, and so her notion of godmother came mostly from fairy tales. Marguerite had gazed down at the baby&#x2019;s tiny pink mouth, which still made the motion of sucking even though the breast was gone, and thought, I will feed you your first escargot. I will pour your first glass of champagne.<br><br>&#x201c;Aunt Daisy?&#x201d; Renata said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, dear,&#x201c; Marguerite said. The poor girl probably thought Marguerite was as crazy as the islanders said she was--self-mutilation, months in a psychiatric hospital, gave up her restaurant--or worse, she thought Marguerite didn&#x2019;t know who she was. How surprised the child would be to find out that Marguerite thought of her, and of Candace, every day. The memories ran through her veins. But enough of that! Marguerite thought. I have the girl on the phone! &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, darling. You caught me by surprise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Were you sleeping?&#x201d; Renata asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s awfully late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201c; Marguerite said. &#x201c;Not sleeping. In bed, reading. Where are you, darling? Are you at school?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t start back for three more weeks,&#x201c; Renata said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, right,&#x201c; Marguerite said. &#x201c;Silly of me.&#x201d; Already she felt like the conversation was a dog she&#x2019;d agreed to take for a walk, one that yanked on its chain, urging Marguerite to catch up. It was August now; when Renata went back to college she&#x2019;d be a... sophomore? Marguerite had sent Renata five thousand dollars for her high school graduation the spring before last--an outrageous sum, though who else did Marguerite have to give her money to? Renata had graduated first in her class, and although she&#x2019;d been accepted at Yale and Stanford, she&#x2019;d decided on Columbia, where Porter was still chairman of the art history department. Renata had sent Marguerite a sweet little thank-you note for the money in loopy script with a lot of exclamation points--and Dan had dashed off a note as well on his office stationery. Once again, Margo, you&#x2019;ve done too much. Hope you are well. Marguerite noticed he had not actually said thank you, but that would have been hoping for too much. After all these years, Dan still hadn&#x2019;t forgiven her. He thought she sent the money out of guilt when really she had sent it out of love.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you then?&#x201d; Marguerite asked. In his annual Christmas letter, Dan had written about Renata&#x2019;s infatuation with her literature classes, her work-study job in the admissions office, and her roommate, but he had hinted nothing about her summer plans.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here on Nantucket,&#x201c; Renata said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m at 21 Federal.&#x201d;<br><br>Marguerite suddenly felt very warm; sweat broke out on her forehead and under her arms. And menopause for her had ended sometime during the first Clinton administration.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re here?&#x201d; Marguerite said.<br><br>&#x201c;For the weekend. Until Sunday. I&#x2019;m here with my fianc�.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His name is Cade,&#x201c; Renata said. &#x201c;His family has a house on Hulbert Avenue.&#x201d;<br><br>Marguerite stroked the fraying satin edge of her summer blanket. Fianc� at age nineteen? And Dan had allowed it? The boy must be rich, Marguerite thought sardonically. Hulbert Avenue. But even she had a hard time believing that Dan would give Renata away while she ...</p></p><h2>Thinking Basketball</h2><p>Are top scorers really the most valuable players?

There was a time when food was our medicine, and the farmer our physician. But now industrialization has converted farms into factories, replaced produce for processed foods, and meat comes with just as many warnings as the drugs we are prescribed. If we continue to embrace the Standard American Diet (SAD diet) and current health care system, this may be the first generation of parents to outlive their children. The science and medical community are split 50/50 as to why we are so sick. One side is dogmatically attached to the theory that germs cause disease, so sickness is inevitable and can only be treated not cured. The other perspective is that we have a genetic predisposition to disease and that science &amp; technology provide the solution. However, neither of these philosophies actually address the real cause of disease. Vegucation Over Medication bridges the gap by helping us understand the impact of nutrition on our health. Dr. Bobby Price provides actionable advice on how to prevent and even reverse many chronic diseases. The book dispels in shocking detail many of the myths and lies we&#x2019;ve adopted as truths, such as the use of medications as our primary form of prevention. Dr. Price&#x2019;s holistic approach to understanding the healing nature of our foods and bodies will empower you to cleanse, nourish, and RECLAIM YOUR HEALTH.

Told with a brief text and dynamic illustrations, <i>t</i>he book<i> </i>opens with a boy's excitement upon seeing the first snowflake fall outside his classroom window. It ends with the neighborhood's immense relief upon seeing the first snowplow break through on their street. In between the boy watches his familiar landscape transform into something alien, and readers watch him transform into a hero who puts the needs of others first. John uses an increasing amount of white space in his playful images, which include a gatefold spread of the boy's expedition to the store. This book about the wonder of a winter storm is as delicious as a mug of hot cocoa by the fire on a snowy day.<br> <strong>Praise for Super Hair-o and the Barber of Doom<br><br></strong>"With a light, humorous touch, Rocco reveals that sometimes the Kryptonite is all in your head."<br> -<em>-Publishers Weekly</em><br><br>"Bold, colorful pen-and-ink illustrations burst with power from each spread in comic-book style.

Over many decades, she has also collaborated with neuroscientists, clinicians, and psychologists to understand how contemplative practice can be a vehicle for social transformation. Through her unusual background, she developed an understanding of how our greatest challenges can become the most valuable source of our wisdom&#x2015;and how we can transform our experience of suffering into the power of compassion for the benefit of others.</p><p>Halifax has identified five psychological territories she calls Edge States&#x2015;altruism, empathy, integrity, respect, and engagement&#x2015;that epitomize strength of character. Yet each of these states can also be the cause of personal and social suffering. In this way, these five psychological experiences form edges, and it is only when we stand at these edges that we become open to the full range of our human experience and discover who we really are. </p><p>Recounting the experiences of caregivers, activists, humanitarians, politicians, parents, and teachers, incorporating the wisdom of Zen traditions and mindfulness practices, and rooted in Halifax&#x2019;s groundbreaking research on compassion, <i>Standing at the Edge </i>is destined to become a contemporary classic. A powerful guide on how to find the freedom we seek for others and ourselves, it is a book that will serve us all.</p></p><p><b>Roshi Joan Halifax, Ph.D., </b>is a Buddhist teacher, Zen priest and anthropologist.

She started creating the tremendously popular webcomic series Cucumber Quest in 2011 and it is her first published work.Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;D.G. presents a second print installment based on her hit webcomic Cucumber Quest. This leg of the quest centers on the watery Ripple Kingdom (one of the seven realms of Dreamside), where bunny siblings Cucumber and Almond have been separated. Almond is a fighter but finds herself at the mercy of Splashmaster, a giant squid with an abysmally low intelligence score. Reluctant hero Cucumber has washed ashore and rescues Princess Nautilus from a mob of crabs. Cucumber and Almond eventually reunite to defeat the Splashmaster, who is one of the henchmen of the Nightmare Knight, the "big bad" summoned once every 5,000 years to help a greedy mortal bent on world domination. With the help of a hilarious supporting cast, Cucumber and Almond must save the land of Dreamside once and for all. D.G.'s comic has transitioned from web to page beautifully, with the exception of a few scene transitions that aren't quite clear. Readers looking for high action and ridiculous comedy will devour this tale. While this title can stand alone, those who are familiar with the first installment will get more out of it. Soft lines and saturated color convey light and emotion perfectly, creating a style sure to draw elementary and middle grade readers alike. VERDICT Jump in! The water in Ripple Kingdom is just fine, even if it is chock-full of sassy crabs and one giant vacuous squid.

Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents.

You need <b>On the Farm</b>.<br><br>Covering the case of one of North America's most prolific serial killer gave Stevie Cameron access not only to the story as it unfolded over many years in two British Columbia courthouses, but also to information unknown to the police - and not in the transcripts of their interviews with Pickton - such as from Pickton's long-time best friend, Lisa Yelds, and from several women who survived terrifying encounters with him. You will now learn what was behind law enforcement's refusal to believe that a serial killer was at work.<br><br>Stevie Cameron first began following the story of missing women in 1998, when the odd newspaper piece appeared chronicling the disappearances of drug-addicted sex trade workers from Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside. It was February 2002 before Robert William Pickton was arrested, and 2008 before he was found guilty, on six counts of second-degree murder. These counts were appealed and in 2010, the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its conclusion. The guilty verdict was upheld, and finally this unprecedented tale of true crime can be told.</p><p>A woman of many talents, Stevie Cameron is a successful author, investigative journalist, commentator and humanitarian. Her investigative reports have been published by the <i>Globe and Mail</i> and <i>Maclean's</i>, among others, and her award-winning books have brought scandals to the public eye. They include the #1 national bestseller <b>On the Take: Crime, Corruption and Greed in the Mulroney Years</b> and <b>The Last Amigo: Karlheinz Schreiber and the Anatomy of a Scandal</b>, winner of the Crime Writers of Canada Arthur Ellis Award. Cameron's passions for writing, uncovering and dissecting stories of the day have earned her acclaim as one of Canada's foremost investigative journalists. She lives in Toronto.<b>Chapter One</b><br><b>THE FAMILY FARM</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Calling the Pickton place a farm back in 1995 is probably a nice way of putting it. The property, at 963 Dominion Road, across the road from a new shopping centre, was nothing more than a junkyard of old cars, trucks and machinery and enormous mounds of dirt, many of which were covered with black plastic tarps. The Pickton brothers, among their many interests, were in the dirt-moving business. Their shabby white clapboard farmhouse needed painting and repair; the wooden outbuildings&#x2014;a rickety mess of garages, workshops and sheds&#x2014;always seemed on the verge of collapse. A shanty that had housed a pigpen had fallen down completely and no one had bothered to tidy up the mess. With no place to keep the pigs, Robert was now stuffing the live weanlings he bought every week at animal auctions into a small horse trailer until he got around to slaughtering them. Only an unpainted hip-roofed Dutch barn looked as if it could last a few more years.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even though Port Coquitlam was a working-class town of fifty thousand people where few had money to spend fixing up their places, the Pickton farm was infamous, and not just because it was a mess. People knew that the Picktons, who were making a fortune selling off chunks of the land to real estate developers, could easily afford to keep the farm in good repair; it just never occurred to them. That was just how they&#x2019;d been brought up, not to mind a little mess.<br>&nbsp;<br>This property wasn&#x2019;t the family&#x2019;s original farm. Louise and Leonard Francis Pickton, the parents of David, Robert and Linda, had inherited a family homestead a few kilometres west, on the other side of town in the larger adjoining community of Coquitlam. Louise and Leonard called it L. F. Pickton Ranch Poultry and Pigs. The address, in those days, was 2426 Pitt River Road but it later changed to 2426 Cape Horn.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today much of this land is crammed with tract housing, but the area in those days was like a vast park blessed with woods, fields and streams, and bears that roamed through the forests around the new hospital. Although the communities here, east of Vancouver, were always mostly working-class, their situation in those days was as favoured as any in the area. The river brimmed with salmon, wild blackberry bushes competed with abundant harvests from the fields and gardens, and the climate was mild. The Coast Mountains to the north and the Cascade Mountains to the south, along the Canada&#x2013;United States border, girdled the entire area except the western side, towards Point Grey, at the far end of Vancouver.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Pickton children&#x2014;Leonard, Harold, Clifford and Lillian&#x2014;went to Millside Elementary School, which had been built in 1905, at 1432 Burnett Street in Coquitlam, and the family attended church services at St. Catherine&#x2019;s Anglican Church in Port Coquitlam.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lillian married and left the farm, Clifford wound up running a nursing home called the Royal Crescent Convalescent Home and Harold became a night watchman at Flavelle Cedar, a local lumberyard. When Leonard finally inherited the property, he stayed on the farm, although his brothers built houses on lots carved out of the property.<br>&nbsp;<br>During the 1940s, Leonard, who had been born in England on July 19, 1896, three years before his parents emigrated to Canada, was considered lazy and unambitious by most people who knew him. He seemed to be a confirmed bachelor, content just to work on the farm, but he astonished his relatives by announcing that he was engaged. And not just engaged: he&#x2019;d snared a woman sixteen years younger than he was, someone he&#x2019;d met in a coffee shop. It may have been one of his smarter moves; Helen Louise Pickton&#x2014;born March 20, 1912, in Calgary, Alberta, but raised in a little place called Raymond&#x2019;s Creek, not far from Swift Current, Saskatchewan&#x2014;became the driving force in the family.<br>&nbsp;<br>Linda, their eldest, was born in 1948. Robert, who was called Robbie as a toddler and then almost always Willie, followed on October 24, 1949, and David arrived a year later, in 1950. Willie&#x2019;s birth was difficult; he was born with the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and his family wondered afterwards if that had caused some kind of brain damage. But there was nothing wrong with his memory; it has always been remarkable. One of his earliest recollections, he always tells people, is of being only two, living in what had been a chicken coop, and having to lift a floorboard under his bed to get cold water from a spring that ran below. It was the only running water in the house for years.<br>&nbsp;<br>He also likes to tell people about the time, when he was just three years old, that he crashed his father&#x2019;s truck, loaded with pigs, into a tree. He was sitting on the driver&#x2019;s side of his father&#x2019;s 1940 &#x201c;Maple Leaf&#x201d; truck, a Canadian-made General Motors vehicle beloved by farmers in the 1930s and &#x2019;40s. Today a Maple Leaf truck is a collector&#x2019;s item; back then it was a just plain, solid workhorse. Years later, in 1991, Pickton described the incident in detail to a pen pal named Victoria when he sent her an audio letter he called &#x201c;Bob&#x2019;s Memoirs.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I turn around and the truck started rolling, the pigs all start jumping off and my dad&#x2019;s running behind the pigs trying to holler to stop the truck,&#x201d; he says on the tape. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know what to do so I smashed it right into a telephone pole. Totalled the truck right out. I sure got the hell beaten out of me. But that&#x2019;s what happens.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A year later his mother caught Willie smoking a cigarette and forced him to smoke a cigar to cure him for good. It worked. &#x201c;That was the last cigarette I ever had,&#x201d; he said years later.<br>&nbsp;<br>By anyone&#x2019;s standards, Louise Pickton was strange. She didn&#x2019;t just look weird; she behaved outside the norms of convention almost all the time, and as she got older her eccentricity became legendary. To start with, there is no getting past how she looked and how she talked. Like Leonard, she didn&#x2019;t pay attention to her teeth and eventually most of them rotted out. She lost most of her hair and covered the remaining wisps with a kerchief. Her chin sprouted so many hairs she developed a little goatee that neighbourhood children have never forgotten. &#x201c;That would blow my mind as a little kid,&#x201d; remembers one man who occasionally visited the farm as a child. &#x201c;I would just say to myself, Cut it off!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And he remembers Louise&#x2019;s voice, a persistent high screech: &#x201c;You kids git over here, now!&#x201d; No one remembers seeing her in shoes, just a pair of men&#x2019;s thick rubber gumboots. &#x201c;She waddled like a duck,&#x201d; another former neighbour says.<br>&nbsp;<br>Stout and short, with a round face, Louise always wore a cotton housedress over a pair of men&#x2019;s jeans; when it rained she&#x2019;d put on an old jacket of Leonard&#x2019;s. He dressed in much the same kind of costume as his wife: a grubby T-shirt hanging over dirty heavy blue jeans rolled over black rubber boots, and a beat-up old hat. Two of Louise&#x2019;s children, Linda and Dave, who are also round-faced and short, resemble her, while Willie, tall and narrow-faced with a long, pointed nose, looks like his father. &#x201c;Rat-faced,&#x201d; people used to say.<br>&nbsp;<br>The strongest memories that former neighbours have of Louise today are associated with the family house on Dawes Hill, and later on Dominion Avenue: the smell, the mess, the dirt. Louise didn&#x2019;t care if the farm animals&#x2014;chickens, ducks, dogs, even the occasional pig or cow they raised&#x2014;roamed in and out of the house. She didn&#x2019;t seem to notice the piles of manure they left behind; she was oblivious to the smell. It was basically a pig farm, after all, and anyone who has lived downwind of one knows what that smell of fresh pig manure is like: piercing and foul, clogging the back of your throat, sticking like scum to your hair and skin. Because the kids had to slop up to two hundred pigs and clean out their pens before and after school, they stank too. They also cleaned up after eight cows that the family milked by hand. In his taped letter to Victoria, Willie said his father delivered the milk to their neighbours.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The old man also used to pick up garbage from Essondale for his pigs; he&#x2019;d go up there with his truck to get a freebie,&#x201d; remembers a man who used to deliver a newspaper to the Picktons. &#x201c;It seems to me they always had some old trucks around; they were scroungers. They were survivors, resourceful&#x2014;they had their own ways of doing stuff.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The farm . . . I can see it: ramshackle, a lot of buildings, went on for about half a block. There was a muddy path down the middle. It was just one shack after another, made up of scraps of lumber. I didn&#x2019;t go down there. It was so repulsive.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Once a week or so the kids might have a bath, but it was impossible to get rid of the smell. Neighbouring farmers called Leonard &#x201c;Piggy&#x201d; and he never seemed to mind. But the local kids called the boys the same thing, and it hurt. Their own memories of those years are not cozy and warm.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Things are so modernized these days it&#x2019;s unbelievable&#x2014;I had a hard life, I&#x2019;m telling you, I had a hard life,&#x201d; Willie told his pen pal years later. He always told people about the homemade or hand-me-down clothes they wore, except for the time Louise bought him a crisp new outfit for Christmas. He was only about five years old, he said, but it was heavily starched and he hated it. &#x201c;It hurts me, it hurts me,&#x201d; he complained to his mother, and then he remembers tearing it off and running away in his bare skin.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;These are the stupid things we kind of do,&#x201d; he told Victoria. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re never used to new clothes . . . I was being brought up very, very poorly.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Even while she was oblivious to the squalor of their lives, Louise wanted her kids to go to Sunday school and birthday parties and ride the school bus like the other children.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Linda and I went to elementary school together from grade one on and she used to come to the same birthday parties I went to,&#x201d; remembers one of her classmates. &#x201c;She wore simple clothes [ordinarily] but her mother would get her party dresses.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>As far as Sunday school went, the only child Louise could bully into going was Linda. Most of the local kids hated it. An elderly retired couple ran it from their small house, right next to the Pickton pig farm. &#x201c;The Sunday school teacher would come to the foot of the driveway in her big old black Dodge, beep her horn and pick up all the kids,&#x201d; the classmate said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Louise had some understanding that it was important for Linda to be like other kids, to have nice clothes, to be included. The same rules didn&#x2019;t apply to the boys. They didn&#x2019;t go to Sunday school; they rarely played with other kids. They hung out together, and when they weren&#x2019;t slopping pigs, they ran wild in the woods around the farm. Like their father, the children went to Millside Elementary on Burnett, where the salmon would come up from the Fraser Creek and spawn. The creeks ran through the farms, including the Picktons&#x2019; place, so the boys fished, sometimes with a few neighbourhood children. The most exciting thing that could happen was the arrival of black bears that would amble around the hill looking for pigs to catch at the Pickton farm.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;When one showed up,&#x201d; remembers a former neighbour, &#x201c;the Picktons would call the game warden, who&#x2019;d track it down with dogs all over the farm. The kids would follow. Then they [the warden] would shoot the bear. And all this time the pigs were running free. There was no vegetation where the pigs were because they&#x2019;d eaten everything and dug big mudholes under the roots of tree stumps. It was a zoo. We&#x2019;d go there to try to make the pigs chase us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>As parents, it&#x2019;s clear that Louise and Leonard were appalling failures. Still, Louise tried in her own twisted way to do her best. She looked out for Willie in particular, knowing that he had a harder time than the others; he was shy and school was almost always an ordeal for him.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Robert, he just adored Mom,&#x201d; his sister Linda told <i>Vancouver Sun </i>reporter Kim Bolan in 2002. &#x201c;He and Mom were so close. Robert was never close to Dad. Robert was kind of Mom&#x2019;s boy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Willie, who started grade one at Millside School in 1955, when he was one month away from his sixth birthday, remembered it later as a one-room school with four grades. &#x201c;It was quite nice because we had four different blackboards,&#x201d; he told his pen pal. But a month after he started at Millside he was moved to Viscount Alexander, which was also in Coquitlam. His standard education test results were, according to school records, &#x201c;very low.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grade two was harder for him. His results were a bit better but still &#x201c;low,&#x201d; and his teacher decided he needed to be held back and repeat the year. Like all the other kids, Willie had to take standard education tests; by the end of his second try at grade two he was performing at an &#x201c;average&#x201d; level. The tests in those years were a mix of standard elementary achievement tests not designed to take into account rural children who might not have access to the advantages of urban kids. In more recent years, with his rural background factored in, Pickton&#x2019;s test results might have shown him to be doing at least as well as his classmates. His parents certainly never read to him; they would not have encouraged his reading skills, and word recognition was an important factor in scoring higher on these tests.<br>&nbsp;<br>By the time he was ready for grade three, in the fall of 1958, the school made a decision to place Willie in a class for slow students. He remained in &#x201c;special education&#x201d; for the rest of his years in school, even after transferring to a different public school, Mary Hill Elementary in Port Coquitlam. More tests showed that he was performing at the level of a grade-five student, but again the tests were, as teachers sometimes called them, &#x201c;urbanized,&#x201d; or set for more sophisticated city kids.<br>&nbsp;<br>The special ed classes, as they were known, usually had fewer students and more help from teachers. And his tests did show slight improvement year over year in both reading and arithmetic, from outright failure to bare passes in most courses. Robert&#x2019;s teachers at Mary Hill Elementary nudged him in the direction of occupational classes in high school&#x2014;blue-collar jobs that wouldn&#x2019;t require a high level of education or training. So that&#x2019;s the stream he chose when he turned thirteen and moved on to grade eight at Mary Hill Secondary School in September 1963.<br>&nbsp;<br>During these years Willie&#x2019;s attendance was as regular as any other student&#x2019;s; clearly his parents weren&#x2019;t putting up with any nonsense about skipping school. He must have wanted to, desperately. Free time on the farm&#x2014;what there was of it after the chores were done&#x2014;was basically unsupervised. School, on the other hand, was a nightmare, not just for Willie but for his brother and sister as well. Part of the reason was that they were shunned by the children, most of them doctors&#x2019; kids, who lived closest to them.<br>&nbsp;<br>For several years the Picktons&#x2019; nearest neighbour was the new Essondale Hospital, built on a thousand acres of cleared land at the top of their hill to house mental patients.

Keith Baker's playful, rhyming text and bold collage illustrations capture the excitement of a day's adventures--and gently introduce counting.<br></p><p><b>KEITH BAKER</b> has written and illustrated many adored picture books, among them <i>Little Green</i>, <i>Big Fat Hen</i>, and<i> Who Is the Beast?</i> He lives in Seattle, Washington. <br>Lush, layered, cut-paper illustrations of ducklings in a marshy landscape create visual density that contrasts with the simplicity of the narrative in this attractive early math book. The book ever-so-gently introduces addition, dividing the seven ducks into different groupings. Starting with "6 plus 1," Baker (Big Fat Hen) moves one duck at a time to the right-hand page, so he works through all possible combinations. For example, the lines "Splashing as they leap and dive/ 7 ducklings, 2 plus 5" clarify a picture of two ducks diving into a pond to join five that are already swimming on the other page; in the next spread, one duck is on the left page, six are bottoms-up on the right. The artwork often camouflages the septet, making the counting a fun challenge: the ducklings sometimes overlap, or readers can spot them among the ferns and grasses. Baker varies the engaging compositions and characterizes the ducks as a lively bunch: in one scene they play hide-and-seek, and in another they gather in two rings to test out their lungs ("Quack-quack-quacking on the shore"). Ladybugs, snails and other wildlife keep the ducks company. This deceptively straightforward book introduces youngsters to addition in such an unobtrusive, organic and merry way that they may not even notice how much they're learning. Ages 2-7.

Hare and Woods are married and live in North Carolina.<p></p><p>When we brought our new baby home from the hospital, our dog Tassie was faced with a dilemma. Since the day we adopted him from a shelter as a puppy, Tassie has had a basket of stuffed toys. Growing up, his favorite activity was to rip out the stuffing and leave it all over the house. Every now and then we would fill up the basket with new toys he could rip up all over again.</p><p>We also gave our baby, Malou, a basket of stuffed toys, which was almost identical to Tassie&#x2019;s. As Malou started to crawl, she quickly developed the habit of dragging the toys out of her basket and leaving them all over the house.</p><p>Here was the dilemma. Of the dozens of toys, Tassie had to figure out which ones were his to rip up, or Malou was going to find her favorite toys in a heap of stuffing and there would be trouble.</p><p>Tassie turned out to be rather good at it. Of course, we were hopeful Tassie would have this ability, since Brian&#x2019;s colleague at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, Juliane Kaminski, studied a dog named Rico who had solved a similar problem. Kaminski received a phone call one day from a very nice German lady saying she had a Border collie who understood more than two hundred German words, mostly the names of children&#x2019;s toys. This was impressive but not unheard of. Language-trained bonobos, bottlenose dolphins, and African grey parrots have learned a similar number of names for objects. What was different about Rico was <i>how</i> he learned the names of these objects.</p><p>If you show a child a red block and a green block, then ask for &#x201c;the chromium block, not the red block,&#x201d; most children will give you the green block, despite not knowing that the word <i>chromium</i> can refer to a shade of green. The child <i>inferred</i> the name of the object.</p><p>Kaminski gave Rico a similar test. She placed a new object Rico had never seen before in a different room with seven of his toys that he knew by name. Then she asked him to fetch a toy using a new word he had never heard before, like <i>Sigfried</i>. She did this with dozens of new objects and words.</p><p>Just like children, Rico inferred that the new words referred to the new toys.</p><p>Without any training, Tassie has never ripped up one of Malou&#x2019;s toys instead of his own. His toys and her toys can be lying in a jumble on the floor, and he will carefully extract his toys and play with them, giving her toys only a longing glance or a quick sniff. He adapted quicker than we did to life with a new baby.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>In the last ten years, there has been something of a revolution in the study of canine intelligence. We have learned more about how dogs think in the past decade than we have in the previous century.</p><p>This book is about how cognitive science has come to understand the genius of dogs through experimental games using nothing much more high-tech than toys, cups, balls, and anything else lying around the garage. With these modest tools, we have been able to peer into the rich cognitive world of dogs and how they make inferences and flexibly solve new problems.</p><p>Thinking about dog genius will not only help us enrich their lives but also broaden how we think about human intelligence. Many of the same concepts used to study dog intelligence are being applied to humans. Perhaps the greatest gift our dogs will give us is a better understanding of ourselves.</p><p>Everyone has an opinion about what makes dogs smart. There is now an extensive scientific literature examining dog psychology that sometimes supports or doesn&#x2019;t support these opinions. To help all dog lovers debate what the latest scientific findings might mean, this book provides a comprehensive review of dog cognition, or &#x201c;dognition.&#x201d;</p><p>We have read thousands of scientific papers relevant to the study of dog cognition, and we reference more than six hundred of the most important and interesting of these papers in this book. If you are interested, there are ways to get access to these papers and read them for yourself.*</p><p>While our review is comprehensive, it covers only areas that have been scientifically studied. We may not cover some areas of interest simply because no scientist has published anything on the topic. But on the flip side, there is tons of fascinating research on dognition you may never have imagined.</p><p>Although we have done our best to represent the literature fairly, not every scientist will agree with everything we report. Whenever we could, we highlighted alternative perspectives or competing data in the main text. But for ease of reading, we have provided extensive notes at the back of the book that cover important details and alternative findings when they are available.</p><p>Disagreement and debate in science are healthy and exciting. Disagreement often drives research that leads to advances in our understanding. Scientists rely on skepticism and empirical debate as a road to the truth. So do not be alarmed if your intuition or your own observations lead you to be skeptical of some of the evidence we present. You are just being a good scientist.</p><p>We hope that when you finish this book, your new knowledge, combined with your own observations, will lead to interesting discussions and debates with your fellow dog lovers. Through these debates, we can learn how to have an even richer relationship with our dogs. We can also identify areas where we need more understanding or where scientists have not even asked the right questions. This is all part of the fun.</p><p>What we know for certain is that the cognitive world of every dog is far more complex and interesting than we thought possible. We also have a tantalizing glimpse into the secret of their success. We can now pinpoint the stuff of dog genius.</p><p>Brian had the good fortune to play a significant role in the unfolding of this story of discovery&#x2014;as did his childhood dog Oreo. Some of what is laid out in the following pages will shock even the most knowledgeable dog owners. It is not always obvious where dogs will show an ability to make inferences or show more flexibility than other species. But in the end, your intuition is correct&#x2014;your dog <i>is </i>a genius.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The many flavors of genius</p><p>Can I really be serious about the title? Most dogs can do little more than sit and stay, and can barely walk on a leash. They are baffled when a squirrel disappears up a tree by circling the trunk, and most will happily drink out of the toilet bowl. This is not the profile of a typical genius. Forget Shakespearean sonnets, spaceflight, or the Internet. If I used the clich�d definition of genius, this would be a very short book.</p><p>I am serious, and hundreds of studies and the latest research back me up. This is because in cognitive science, we think about intelligence in animals a little differently. The first thing we look at, when judging the intelligence of animals, is how successfully they have managed to survive and reproduce in as many places as possible. In some species, such as cockroaches, success does not have much to do with intelligence at all. They are just very hardy and excellent reproducers.</p><p>But with other animals, surviving takes a little more intellect, and a very specific kind of intellect. For instance, it does not do any good composing sonnets if you are a dodo. You are obviously missing the intelligence you need to survive (in the dodo&#x2019;s case, this was learning to avoid new predators such as hungry sailors).</p><p>With this as our starting point, the dog is arguably the most successful mammal on the planet, besides us. Dogs have spread to all corners of the world, including inside our homes, and in some cases onto our beds. While the majority of mammals on the planet have seen a steep decline in their populations as a result of human activity, there have never been more dogs on the planet than today. In the industrialized world, people are having fewer children than ever but are simultaneously providing an increasingly lavish lifestyle for a growing population of pet dogs. Meanwhile, dogs have more jobs than ever. Service dogs assist the mentally or physically disabled, military dogs find bombs, police dogs do guard duty, customs dogs detect illegally imported goods, conservation dogs find scat to help estimate population sizes and movements of endangered animals, bedbug dogs detect when hotels have a problem, cancer dogs detect melanomas or even intestinal cancer, therapy dogs visit retirement homes and hospitals to lift spirits and speed recoveries.</p><p>I am fascinated with the kind of intelligence that has allowed dogs to be so successful. Whatever it is&#x2014;this must be their genius.</p><p>What Is Genius?</p><p>Most of us have at some time been given a test where scores determine how we are taught or which college we get into. Alfred Binet designed the first standardized intelligence tests in the early twentieth century. His goal was to identify students in France who should receive extra scholastic attention and resources. His original test evolved into the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, which is known as the IQ test.</p><p>IQ tests provide a very narrow definition of genius. As you probably remember, tests such as IQ tests, GREs, and SATs focus on basic skills like reading, writing, and analytical abilities. The tests are favored because <i>on average,</i> they predict scholastic success. But they do not measure the full capabilities of each person. They do not explain Ted Turner, Ralph Lauren, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg, who all dropped out of college and became billionaires.</p><p>Consider Steve Jobs. One biographer said, &#x201c;Was he smart? No, not exceptionally. Instead he was a genius.&#x201d; Jobs dropped out of college, went to find himself in India, and at one point was forced out of Apple, the company he co-founded, when sales were slow in 1985. Few would have predicted the level of his success by his death. &#x201c;Think different&#x201d; became the slogan of a multinational monolith that fused art and technology under his guidance. Jobs may have been average or unexceptional in many domains, but his vision and ability to think differently made him a genius.</p><p>A cognitive approach is about celebrating different kinds of intelligence. Genius means that someone can be gifted with one type of cognition while being average or below average in another.</p><p>Temple Grandin, at Colorado State University, is autistic yet is also the author of several books, including <i>Animals Make Us Human,</i> and has done more for animal welfare than almost anyone. Although Grandin struggles to read people&#x2019;s emotions and social cues, her extraordinary understanding of animals has allowed her to reduce the stress of millions of farm animals.</p><p>The cognitive revolution changed the way we think about intelligence. It began in the decade that all social revolutions seemed to have happened, the sixties. Rapid advances in computer technology allowed scientists to think differently about the brain and how it solves problems. Instead of the brain being either more or less full of intelligence, like a glass of wine, the brain is more like a computer, where different parts work together. USB ports, keyboards, and modems bring in new information from the environment; a processor helps digest and alter the information into a usable format, while a hard drive stores important information for later use. Neuroscientists realized that, like a computer, many parts of the brain are specialized for solving different types of problems.</p><p>Neuroscience and computer technology highlighted the fatal flaws in the idea of a single-dimensional measure of intelligence. People with well-tuned perceptual systems might be gifted athletes or artists; people with less sensitive emotional systems will succeed as fighter pilots or in other high-risk jobs; and those with unusual memories might do well as doctors. This same phenomenon can be observed in mental disorders. There are myriad cognitive abilities that are not necessarily interdependent on one another.</p><p>One of the best-studied cognitive abilities is memory. In fact, we usually think of geniuses as people who have an extraordinary memory for facts and figures, since such people often score off the charts in IQ tests. But just as there are different types of intelligence, there are different types of memory. There is memory for events, faces, navigation, things that occurred recently or long ago&#x2014;the list goes on. If you have a good memory in one of these areas, it does not necessarily mean your other types of memory are equally as good.</p><p>For instance, a woman known as AJ (to protect her identity) had a remarkable autobiographical memory. She could remember when and where almost everything happened in her life. When experimenters named various dates, she could report with uncanny precision important personal and public events that occurred&#x2014;even down to the time of day. But her memory applied only to autobiographical events. She was not a particularly good student and struggled with rote memorization.</p><p>In another study, neuroscientists found that London taxi drivers had a higher density of neurons in an area of the brain called the hippocampus. The hippocampus is involved in navigation, and a higher density of neurons means more storage capacity and faster processing. This gives taxi drivers unusual abilities in solving new spatial problems requiring navigation between landmarks.</p><p>What makes AJ and taxi drivers worthy of being credited as geniuses is not what standard IQ tests measure. Rather it is their specialized, extraordinary memories.</p><p>There are many definitions of intelligence competing for attention in popular culture. But the definition that has guided my research and that applies throughout this book is a very simple one. The genius of dogs&#x2014;of all animals, for that matter, including humans&#x2014;has two criteria:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;A mental skill that is strong <i>compared with others, </i>either within your own species or in closely related species.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;The ability to spontaneously make<i> inferences</i>.<p>Animal Genius&#x2014;Not All Just Song and Dance</p><p>Arctic terns have a genius for navigation. Each year they fly from the Arctic to Antarctic and back. Every five years a tern will travel the same distance it takes to get to the moon. Whales have an ingenious way of cooperating to catch fish. They create massive walls of bubbles that trap schools of fish, netting them a much heartier dinner than if they hunted alone. Honeybees have evolved a form of dance that allows them to tell other bees where to find nectar-filled flowers&#x2014;it is certainly a form of genius to be able to make your living by dancing.</p><p>Genius is always relative. Certain people are considered geniuses because they are better than others at solving a specific type of problem. In animals, researchers are usually more interested in what a species as a whole is capable of, rather than each individual animal.</p><p>Even though animals cannot talk, we can pinpoint their particular genius by giving them puzzles. Animals do not need to talk to solve these puzzles, they just need to make choices. And these choices reveal their cognitive abilities. By presenting the same puzzle to different species, we can identify different types of anim...</p></p><h2>Hinds&#39; Feet on High Places: The Original and Complete Allegory with a Devotional for Women</h2><p><p>&nbsp;What can be more exciting than the <i>Hinds&#x2019; Feet on High Places</i> allegory?&nbsp;It is the allegory along with a daily devotional penned by a woman who has proven her walk with the Lord and her writing gift with other inspirational books, including <i>You Can Be the Wife of a Happy Husband</i> and the 1999 release, <i>You Can Be the Happy Mom of an Empty Nest</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these devotions are &#x201c;quiet time&#x201d; meditations, ones that will draw you closer to your Lord Jesus.&nbsp;They will help you to understand your own struggles and regain confidence in your walk with the Lord.</p><p>I know that you sense Him drawing you ever nearer to Him.&nbsp;That&#x2019;s why you are considering this devotional.&nbsp;Some of you even feel your heart aching for more of His Presence in your life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This allegory with the devotionals will help satisfy the yearning of your heart.&nbsp;He is challenging you to keep saying &#x201c;yes&#x201d; to your Lord as He beckons you on in your own journey to the High Places.</p></p><p>I know that you sense Him drawing you ever nearer to Him.

Here the beloved author of <i>A Year in Provence</i> pays tribute to the most endearing and enduring aspects of his life in France&#x2014;the charming and indelible parade of village life, the sheer beauty, the ancient history. He celebrates the caf� and lists some of his favorites; identifies his favorite villages, restaurants, and open-air markets; and recounts his most memorable meals. A celebration of twenty-five years of Proven�al living&#x2014;of lessons learned and changes observed&#x2014;with his final book Mayle has crafted a lasting love letter to his adopted home, marked by his signature warmth, wit, and humor.</p><p>Peter Mayle wrote fifteen previous books. He was a proud recipient of the L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur from the French government for his cultural contributions. He died in January 2018.Chapter One<br><br>Early Days<br><br>It started with a lucky break in the weather. My wife, Jennie, and I had escaped the rigors of the English summer to spend two idyllic weeks on the C�te d&#x2019;Azur, which according to popular rumor enjoys three hundred days of sunshine a year. But not that year. It rained, hard and often. The beach umbrellas hung in sodden clumps. The plagistes, those bronzed young men who patrol the beaches, were huddled in their huts, their shorts soaked. Caf�s along the Promenade des Anglais were filled with forlorn parents and fractious children who had been promised a day splashing about in the sea. In the International Herald Tribune, there was news of a heat wave in En�gland. As we prepared to leave Nice, we hoped the heat would last until we got home.<br><br>A situation like this requires some kind of consolation. We considered going across the border to Italy, hopping on the ferry to Corsica, or making the long drive down to Barcelona in time for dinner. But in the end, we decided on exploring France. Instead of taking the autoroutes, we would stay on the smaller secondary roads. Even in the rain, we thought, they would be prettier and more interesting than joining the procession of trucks and caravans on the main highway to the north. And besides, our experience of France had been confined to Paris and the coast. This would be virgin territory.<br><br>In those days, long before GPS, we used maps. And one of the few familiar names we found was Aix-�en-�Provence. There would be restaurants in Aix. There might even be sunshine. Off we went.<br><br>The Route Nationale 7, I think, is the French equivalent of Route 66, which the old song taught us was where to go to get our kicks. The kicks on the RN 7 used to be at their height each year in July and August, when most of Paris took what was then the main road down to the south. It, too, had its famous song, performed by Charles Trenet, the lyrics dripping with le soleil, le ciel bleu, les vacances, and the promise of wonderful times.<br><br>The reality didn&#x2019;t quite live up to the song. The RN 7 is a perpetually busy road, and was filled on that particular day with many of the thousands of trucks that crisscross France, often driven by very large men who look down on passing cars with a faintly menacing air. Overtake me at your peril, they seemed to be thinking. And if you value your life, don&#x2019;t change lanes too suddenly.<br><br>Gradually, the rain was beginning to thin out, and by the time we reached Aix, the gray sky was showing hopeful fragments of blue; to celebrate, we decided to go to the oldest brasserie in town, Les Deux Gar�ons. Founded in 1792, this is more of a historic monument than a mere bar. Past customers include C�zanne and Zola, Picasso and Pagnol, Piaf and Camus. The terrace overlooks the Cours Mirabeau, the most handsome street in Aix, lined with plane trees and dotted with fountains, the perfect spot to watch the passing crowd. There was a moment when the normal air of conviviality had been disturbed by a shooting in one of the toilets. A vile rumor that the culprit was a waiter who had been deprived of his tip was found to be untrue, and life returned to normal.<br><br>Enjoying a glass of ros�, we took another look at the map, where we found a scattering of villages on the northern side of the Luberon mountains. This looked promising, and it was more or less on our way back to En�gland. After a proper Proven�al lunch of rabbit in mustard sauce and an ultra-�fine apple tart, served by a waiter who could have come out of central �casting&#x2014;�white apron, generous belly, and memorably luxuriant �moustache&#x2014;�we felt ready for any mountain we might come across.<br><br>The further we drove from Aix, the more blue sky we saw pushing away the clouds. There was no sun yet, but it was turning into a pleasant afternoon, made even more pleasant by the change in the countryside once we were well away from Aix. It was beautiful, spacious, often quite deserted. Fields of vines and fields of sunflowers easily outnumbered buildings, and what buildings we saw were �charming&#x2014;�weather-�beaten stone, faded roof tiles, usually shaded by a couple of venerable plane trees or an alley of cypresses. This, as we later discovered, was typical Proven�al countryside. We loved it then, and we love it now.<br><br>Every so often, the empty fields gave way to a village, with its church tower presiding over a jumble of stone houses. Several of these had the day&#x2019;s washing hanging out of upstairs windows to dry, which we took as a sign that the locals, who are invariably �expert weather forecasters, were anticipating the sun. And sure enough, as we were entering what was described on the map as the Natural Regional Park of the Luberon, out it came, bright and optimistic, making everything look sharp and clean, as though the landscape had been etched against the sky. Those gray, rainy days in Nice might have happened on a different planet.<br><br>By now, we were getting distant glimpses of the Luberon. It was long and low and its mountains did not seem all that craggy or threatening. They were comfortable mountains. The Luberon even had a road that seemed to go all the way through from the south side, where we were, to the north. We picked up this road outside the village of Lourmarin, and headed north, on what turned out to be the only straight piece of tarmac for several miles. Then came the bends. It was the first time I have ever felt seasick in a car. To make matters worse, the road was narrow, often with a steep wall of rock on one side and a sharp drop on the other. And there was oncoming traffic. Motorcycles were easy enough to dodge, even though they were using the road like a racetrack. Cars could just about pass if we squeezed up against the rock wall. Trailers and motor homes were the challenge, particularly on those bends. We squeezed until we were almost scraping the rock. We sucked in our stomachs and held our breath. Jennie very wisely shut her eyes.<br><br>Relief finally came with a flattening and widening of the road, and a sign pointing to an outpost of civilization, the village of Bonnieux. This turned out to be a postcard village, perched on a hill, with ten-�mile views across the valley. Using the map, we looked for our next stop, and our eye was caught by something marked in bold type: the Village des Bories. What, we wondered, were Bories? Members of a small but privileged tribe, permitted to have their own village? Or perhaps it was a refuge for rare mountain animals? Or even, in these liberated days, a nudist colony? We decided to take a look.<br><br>Not a nudist to be seen when we finally reached the village, but an extraordinary collection of small buildings made, without the benefit of concrete, from six-�inch-�thick slabs of local limestone. These were bories, twenty-�eight of them, looking a little like giant beehives, built during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There were sheep shelters, oven houses, a silkworm-breeding facility, barns, and �granaries&#x2014;�all the modern conveniences of that era, and all very well cared for.<br><br>As one often does after a plunge into history, we emerged in need of refreshment. And luckily, it was available just up the road in the village of Gordes. Today, it is a model of rural sophistication, with good hotels and restaurants, boutiques, and, during the summer, a steady flow of tourists. Back then, it was sleepy, almost empty, and astonishingly beautiful, like a film set made from stone.<br><br>Gordes dates from 1031, and as we walked across the main square it was easy to imagine that not much had changed since then. Centuries of sunshine had left their mark on the complexion of the buildings, leaving them the color of light honey. Centuries of the mistral, the wind that, from time to time, sweeps across Provence, had smoothed the stone surfaces. And, to add to the pleasures of the late afternoon, there was a caf� on the edge of the square.<br><br>We sat on the terrace, with its long-�distance views of the surrounding countryside, and I think this was perhaps the moment that the stirrings of change came to us both. It would, we agreed, be a wonderful place to live. We had both done our terms of office duty, working in London and New York for many long years, and we were ready for a simpler, sunnier life.<br><br>The sun had begun to drop, and we had to start thinking about where to spend the night. The caf� waiter sucked his teeth and shook his head. There was nothing he cared to recommend in Gordes, but if we wanted to go to Cavaillon, the nearest large town, we would undoubtedly find a range of suitable amenities.<br><br>Cavaillon is the melon capital of France; indeed, the melon capital of the world, if you believe the local melon enthusiasts. It&#x2019;s not a strikingly pretty town, more workmanlike than picturesque, but after Gordes it seemed big and bustling. Here, certainly, we would find a decent meal and a bed for the night.<br><br>The hotel was easy. We found it as soon as we came into town: well placed on a main street, slightly shabby, but not without a certain faded charm. The woman at the front desk, herself with a certain faded charm, gave us a smiling welcome.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d like a room for the night, please.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s eyebrows went up. &#x201c;For the night?&#x201d;<br><br>She showed us to a small room in the hotel&#x2019;s main corridor, asked us to pay in advance, and recommended a restaurant two minutes away.<br><br>Chez Georges was our kind of �restaurant&#x2014;�short menu, paper tablecloths, already busy, with an appetizing whiff of cooking each time the kitchen door swung open. We had, of course, Cavaillon melon to start. It was everything a melon should be, fragrant and juicy. The wine we had ordered was served in an earthenware jug by an elderly gentleman who might have been Georges himself. He suggested that we follow the melon with the specialty of the house, steak frites. The steak was excellent, and the French fries were enough to make a gourmet weep with pleasure. They were �perfectly crisp, free of any trace of oil or grease, light and satisfyingly crunchy. If this was Proven�al cooking, we could hardly wait for the next meal.<br><br>But it had been a long day, and bed beckoned. Back at the hotel, we passed a couple of rather furtive-�looking men making their way down the corridor before we reached our room, and we had barely closed our door before there was the sound of more �activity&#x2014;�a girlish giggle, a burst of masculine laughter, a door being closed very firmly. It sounded as though the other residents, clearly a lively bunch, were having a party.<br><br>This went on for most of the night. Doors were banging, footsteps thundered up and down the corridor, and sleep was hard to find. It was some time later that we were told we had spent the night in the local brothel.<br><br>Chatper Two<br><br>Home Sweet Home<br><br>It is one thing to think about changing countries when you&#x2019;re sitting on a sunny caf� terrace, and quite another when you return to the real world. Every day after our return to En�gland, Provence seemed more distant; every day, more desirable. At this stage, we didn&#x2019;t even know whereabouts in Provence we wanted to live. If you include the C�te d&#x2019;Azur (which we don&#x2019;t; it&#x2019;s nothing like the true Provence), the region covers more than thirty thousand square kilometers, from the mountains in the north to the beaches of Cassis and Marseille in the south. So, knowing precious little about our future home, we were at first reduced to daydreaming and reading travel books, which just added to our impatience.<br><br>Jennie, at least, did something constructive by enrolling herself in a French class, where she was surrounded by teenage students. I was already an enthusiastic exponent of schoolboy French, with an accent that had inspired a woman in Gordes to say, &#x201c;Mais monsieur, vous parlez fran�ais comme une vache espagnole!&#x201d; At first, I took this as a colloquial compliment, but she had actually been comparing my accent to that of a Spanish cow.<br><br>As winter began its muddy march across the damp English countryside, we consoled ourselves with maps, the Guide Michelin, and plans to return to Provence in the early summer. This time, we would be more thorough and altogether more businesslike. How much would it cost to live there? Were English refugees made welcome? Did we need official residence permits? Would our two dogs need passports? What about the dreaded French taxes? There were hours of discussion, much of it based on optimism and ignorance. It seemed like the longest winter in living memory, but at last it was over, and we could, mentally at least, put on our shorts and sunglasses. We were ready to go.<br><br>We had often noticed that when the English take their cars abroad, they fill them with as much of En�gland as possible: plenty of tea, a favorite teapot, chocolate biscuits, winter sweaters no matter the time of year just in case, a couple of small deck chairs, umbrellas, and always remedies for an upset stomach, it being well known that foreigners put funny things in their food.<br><br>We tried to keep our car empty, leaving plenty of space for the olive oil and wine that we planned to bring back. One of the delightful distractions when driving through Provence is the number of wine-�growing properties that invite the thirsty passer�by to drop in for a glass or two. This, inevitably, leads to the purchase of a bottle or two. It is a marvelously pleasant and civilized way to go wine shopping. Whether you stop at an old farmhouse or a miniature Versailles at the end of a two-hundred-�yard-�long, tree-�lined drive, the welcome is warm, helpful, and often delicious.<br><br>But first, we had to get there, taking the ferry to Calais and heading south through the vast French countryside. France has more or less the same number of people as Britain, but nearly three times as much land. This is evident when you&#x2019;re driving down from one end of the country to the other; the wide open spaces last for mile after mile, looking as though an army of landscape gardeners has been at work: fields and hedges are neat, fences are well kept, tractor furrows are scrupulously straight. And, more often than not, the landscape is empty: no buildings, no people.</p><h2>Thomas Aquinas in 50 Pages: A Layman&#39;s Quick Guide to Thomism</h2><p>Have you ever wanted to study the theology of Thomas Aquinas, but were intimidated?

Running gags and gross-out humor will keep readers in stitches, with Nina acting as &#x201c;straight goat&#x201d; to the more animated detective&#x2014;when she is not eating the evidence, that is. Bell&#x2019;s cartoonish illustrations appear on almost every page, ramping up the laughs." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The direct storytelling makes the episodic structure engaging but accessible, and the repetition both in the narration and the dialogue (&#x201c;Big deal&#x201d; is a common utterance, especially by Nina) gives multiple opportunities to practice decoding skills. Black and white illustrations can be found on nearly every spread, helpfully giving context clues to readers while moving the story along. This will snare transitioning readers like Flytrap snags his lunch.&#x201d; (<i>BCCB</i>)<br><br>"Generous illustrations spilling across the pages humorously set the mean-streets, noirish scene, complete with beat-up office and Bakelite phone, and Bell manages the challenge of giving a potted plant both personality and verve."

The panic was slow to build at first. People ignored the danger signals, and even the fire department was unable to locate the fire.

It&#x2019;s the story of how she went from being an almost comically inept leader to a sought-after CEO who teaches others how to lead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hadeed unintentionally launched Student Maid while attending college ten years ago. Since then, Student Maid has employed hundreds of students and is widely recognized for its industry-leading retention rate and its culture of trust and accountability. But Kristen and her company were no overnight sensa�tion. In fact, they were almost nothing at all.<br><br> Along the way, Kristen got it wrong almost as often as she got it right. Giving out hugs instead of feed�back, fixing errors instead of enforcing accountability, and hosting parties instead of cultivating meaning�ful relationships were just a few of her many mistakes. But Kristen&#x2019;s willingness to admit and learn from those mistakes helped her give her people the chance to learn from their own screwups too.<br><br> <i>Permission to Screw Up</i>&nbsp;dismisses the idea that leaders and orga�nizations should try to be perfect. It encourages people of all ages to go for it and learn to lead by acting, rather than waiting or thinking. Through a brutally honest and often hilarious account of her own strug�gles, Kristen encourages us to embrace our failures and proves that we&#x2019;ll be better leaders when we do.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Kristen Hadeed </b>is the founder and CEO of Student Maid, a cleaning company that hires students.

Doubly tough when the AC units are down for maintenance and your novice boss doesn&#x2019;t even think to offer you a water break.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I contemplate checking on them but talk myself out of it.

Plus, I told them if they needed me, I&#x2019;d be in the clubhouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I prop up my feet, put in my earbuds, and tell myself I have it all under control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>As you might have guessed, it doesn&#x2019;t take long for things to go south.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Like, way south.<br><br>&#x2014;<br><br>Hours later, I&#x2019;m still perched in my armchair, congratulating myself on how well the day is going so far. We&#x2019;re more than halfway through, and no one has run into a single problem yet (well, no one has <i>told</i> me about any problems, at least).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>As I&#x2019;m about to take the first bite of the Caesar salad I just had delivered, the clubhouse doors swing open, and my employees suddenly start shuffling through single file. It&#x2019;s not just a few of them: As I watch, fork halfway to my mouth, forty-five out of sixty of them crowd into the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>For a split second, I think they&#x2019;re finished cleaning&#x2014;which would be surprising, considering the amount of work I assigned them this morning&#x2014;until I catch sight of their faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>As they spot me, freshly showered, with my hair done and makeup meticulously applied, every single one of them scowls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Yeesh. Why so serious?</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, guys! How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d; I ask cheerfully, trying to lighten the mood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>As they continue to make their way toward me, I can&#x2019;t help but cringe a little. They&#x2019;re all dripping in sweat. There are huge black grease marks on their arms and faces from scrubbing ovens and who knows what else, and they smell like a gross combo of body odor and moldy refrigerator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Bet you can&#x2019;t wait to shower!&#x201d; I joke awkwardly, desperate for just one of them to crack a smile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>More silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>What is going on?</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Suddenly they start whispering to one another, and they begin nudging one person forward. I hear someone say something that sounds like &#x201c;Do it.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Little do I know that I am about to experience the most humiliating thirty seconds of my life. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Slowly, one steps in front of the group. And then, carefully avoiding eye contact with me, she says, &#x201c;We quit.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I almost drop my fork.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Wait . . . wh . . .</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Before I can even think of a response, all forty-five of them turn around at exactly the same moment and begin to make their way out the big double glass doors, dragging their vacuums, buckets, and sponges with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Forty-five people quit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>At the <i>same time.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Seventy-five percent of my team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>That&#x2019;s the moment that inspired my obsession with learning how to be a better leader.<br><br>&#x2014;<br><br>I had no idea what I was in for when I started a cleaning company that hires only students while I was still in college. I&#x2014;a millennial with hardly any leadership experience&#x2014;decided I would hire other millennials&#x2014;a notoriously tough group to work with and retain&#x2014;to do backbreaking, dirty, physical labor that would include cleaning filthy toilets and scouring mildewy bathtubs. Somehow, I thought it would be easy. Ha.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was anything but easy. I didn&#x2019;t know the first thing about building a business, let alone one that&#x2019;s part of an industry as unenticing as housecleaning. The day forty-five people walked out on me foreshadowed the many trials I&#x2019;d face as a leader, which would only get more and more difficult. But with time, patience, and a lot of screwing up, I eventually learned how to overcome the challenges I had unwittingly taken on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>This is the true, imperfect story of how I went from that humiliating summer day to where I am now. It&#x2019;s about how I built a company where people want to be, and where millennials are loyal, productive, and empowered. Even as they do someone else&#x2019;s dirty work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>But before we get to all that, let&#x2019;s back up a bit. To the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I need to explain how I ended up in that clubhouse in the first place. You see, it was never even my intention to start a company.<br><br>&#x2014;<br><br>In my sophomore year of college, I was studying finance at the University of Florida. Why finance? Well, I scoured Monster.com for the highest-paying jobs, and investment banking was at the top of the list. My dream was to move to Manhattan after graduation and get a job on Wall Street that paid a starting salary of no less than $100K per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>At the moment, however, I was&#x2014;as most college students are&#x2014;broke. I had a scholarship, but it barely covered my expenses. This became a problem for me when I walked into the mall and fell in love with a pair of $99 jeans. (Designer jeans and living beyond my means: my nineteen-year-old self in a nutshell.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I called my dad to see if he might be willing to help with my fashion emergency, even though I knew he&#x2019;d say no. (If you saw what my dad wears every day, you&#x2019;d understand that fashion is not exactly an emergency in his eyes.) He told me the one thing I didn&#x2019;t want to hear: Get a job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Getting a job just to buy one pair of jeans sounded a bit extreme, and besides, college was my chance to live it up before I made it to the real world and had to work for the rest of my life. Scholarships had my basic needs covered. I didn&#x2019;t want a job with demanding, inflexible hours getting in the way of studying for midterms (or tailgating at football games), so I decided to figure out a way I could make the money quickly on my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>This entrepreneurial way of thinking wasn&#x2019;t new to me: I&#x2019;ve been a self-starter since I was six, when I started a babysitting service (even though I still needed a babysitter myself) and sold fake nails made of Elmer&#x2019;s glue to my first-grade classmates. After that came the Girls Club, a &#x201c;friendship&#x201d; club that members had to pay $5 to join. They also had to follow my thirteen rules (the seventh of which was simply &#x201c;Obedience&#x201d;). I signed the list, &#x201c;Thanks, Your Leader, Kristen.&#x201d; Yeah. Definitely the same thing as friendship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>So when I found myself needing $99 in college, I wasn&#x2019;t in completely uncharted territory. Because Elmer&#x2019;s glue nails were no longer the hot commodity they were in elementary school, I went with the first viable enterprise that came to mind: cleaning. I figured it would be the best way to make enough money to buy my coveted denim in one go. I was willing to do whatever it took to get those jeans, even if it meant scrubbing a stranger&#x2019;s bathtub.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I put an ad on Craigslist to clean just one house. It went live on a Monday:<br><br><b>NEED HOUSECLEANING HELP?&nbsp; UNBEATABLE SERVICE AND PRICE</b><br>UF student will clean your entire house for $99 (plus tax). I&#x2019;ve never been arrested, convicted of a crime, or anything else like that. I&#x2019;m an extremely good student and have made the Dean&#x2019;s list each semester. I have a 3.8 GPA. Available immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>(I may have rounded up a bit on the GPA.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>By the end of the day, I had a potential customer: a busy mom with a traveling husband, two dogs, two kids, and one messy four-thousand-square-foot house. She emailed me asking for a list of references and wanted to know if I supplied my own products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>References? Hmm.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I gave her the name and phone number of my aunt and my boyfriend at the time. I didn&#x2019;t tell her who they were&#x2014;just that they were &#x201c;previous clients&#x201d; of mine. Luckily, she didn&#x2019;t call them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Supply my own products? I think I can do that. . . .</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I looked under my kitchen sink and found a bottle of glass cleaner and a sponge. I figured I could use my own toilet scrubber. (Gross.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Yep, got everything I need.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>She asked me the soonest date I had available, and we agreed on the following Wednesday afternoon. She gave me her address, and that was that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The night before the big day, I went out to celebrate my friend&#x2019;s twenty-first birthday&#x2014;which, predictably, meant I wasn&#x2019;t exactly feeling that great when I woke up. I slept through several alarms and desperately wished I could reschedule, but then I remembered the jeans. That&#x2019;s all it took to get me out of bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I pulled into the driveway just in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Wow, this place is huge!</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I got out of my car, grabbed my small bag of cleaning supplies, and rang the doorbell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Hello!&#x201d; she said as she cracked open the door, holding the collars of two horse-sized dogs as they tried to jump all over me. They were clearly dying to eat me alive. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re harmless! Come on in.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I stepped into her house. It felt like a sauna.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Sorry it&#x2019;s so hot,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Our AC unit is broken.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Faaaaantastic.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Head pounding and already breaking a sweat, I followed her to the kitchen as she locked the dogs behind a doggie gate that looked like it couldn&#x2019;t prevent a Chihuahua from escaping.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;You can put your cleaning supplies here,&#x201d; she instructed, pointing to the dining room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you have more to get out of your car, but I don&#x2019;t have a lot of time, so perhaps you can get them after I give you a tour?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Sure!&#x201d; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>More supplies to get out of my car? Nope, this is it. Hope that isn&#x2019;t a problem.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;So here&#x2019;s the kitchen, and the big thing here, as you know, is using the right products on the glass stove top.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>As I followed her from room to room, I quickly learned there was a lot I didn&#x2019;t know about housecleaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Make all beds with hospital corners? Remove mildew in the master shower? What does mildew even look like?</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>She continued giving instructions as she gave me the tour, but I couldn&#x2019;t keep up. I knew this probably wouldn&#x2019;t end well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Okay, I think that&#x2019;s it!&#x201d; she concluded. &#x201c;Any questions?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m good!&#x201d; I said in my fake-confident voice. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Great. Well, I need to get back to the office. By the way, how long do you think it will take? Just want to time it right with bringing the kids home.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Let&#x2019;s see. Four thousand square feet. Umm . . .</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Two hours?&#x201d; Sounded reasonable to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Wow! You&#x2019;re quick!&#x201d; she exclaimed as she walked out the door. &#x201c;Call me if you have any trouble!&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I decided to clean her daughter&#x2019;s bedroom first. By the time I&#x2019;d removed the five million Barbies covering the floor and meticulously dusted three shelves of porcelain dolls, an hour had gone by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I needed to pick up the pace. I went through the house, gathered all the laundry, and stuffed as much as I could into the washer. Then I moved on to the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Special products for the glass stove top . . . like glass cleaner? Perfect. That&#x2019;s the one product I have with me. What are the odds?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></i><br>Thirty minutes later, I realized my off-brand Windex was not cutting it; there were still grease spots everywhere. My two-hour time limit was up, and I had successfully straightened up one wing of the house and semicleaned the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>How was this taking so long? Even the dogs were judging me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I decided to call her. I told her it would take another hour, and she was okay with that but warned me she would be coming home soon with the kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>One hour later, she pulled into the driveway. I was still cleaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>In the end, my two-hour estimate turned into more like seven hours. I was still cleaning while she made her kids dinner, gave them baths, and put them to bed. But somehow, with a throbbing head, no AC, and only glass cleaner, a sponge, and a used toilet scrubber, I got through that entire house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When I was done, it looked okay. Not great, but better than it did before. She paid me, and I left.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I thought that was the end of the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>But really, it was just the beginning.<br><br>&#x2014;<br><br>The next day, two hours after I left the mall triumphantly holding my new jeans, a funny thing happened.

Nowhere in the Bible does the Lord promise us this, say Michael Brown and Craig Keener, two leading, acclaimed Bible scholars. In fact, they say, Jesus <i>promises</i> us tribulation in this world.<br><br>Yet this is no reason to fear. In this fascinating, accessible, and personal book, Brown and Keener walk you through what the Bible <i>really</i> says about the rapture, the tribulation, and the end times. What they find will leave you full of hope. God's wrath is not poured out on His people, and He will shield us from it--as he shielded Israel in Egypt during the ten plagues. So instead of taking comfort in what God hasn't promised, take comfort in the words of Jesus: He has overcome the world, and we live in his victory.</p><p><b>What if </b><b><i>everybody</i></b><b> was left behind?<br><br></b>Despite the popular belief that Christians will be raptured before the start of the Tribulation, Scripture paints a very different picture.

Why expensive name-brand medicines provide better pain relief than the generic stuff, even if they share the same ingredients. And why a hospital room with a good view speeds up recovery from surgery.</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>The truth is, the way we think about ourselves and the world around us dramatically impacts our happiness, health, how fast or slow we age, and even how long we live. In fact, people with a positive mindset about aging live on average 7.5 years longer than those without.&nbsp;</p> <p>That might sound alarming to those of us who struggle to see the bright side, but the good news is we can make surprisingly simple changes or small shifts to how we think, feel, and act that will really pay off.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <em>The Positive Shift: Mastering Mindset to Improve Happiness, Health, and Longevity</em>, Dr. Catherine Sanderson breaks down the science of thought and shows how our mindset&#x2014;or thought pattern&#x2014;exerts a substantial influence on our psychological and physical health. Most important, this book demonstrates how, no matter what our natural tendency, with practice we can make minor tweaks in our mindset that will improve the quality&#x2014;and longevity&#x2014;of our life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Combining cutting-edge research from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and medicine, as well as vivid real-world examples of the power of mindset, <em>The Positive Shift </em>gives readers practical and easy strategies for changing maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors so they can live longer, happier lives. These behaviors include:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Appreciating nature</strong>, with actions as simple as eating lunch outside</li> <li><strong>Giving to others</strong>, like volunteering</li> <li><strong>Spending money on experiences</strong>, not possessions&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Living your best life is truly mind over matter.

Herbert A. Werner, one of the few surviving German U-boat commanders, served on five submarines from 1941 to 1945. From the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, from the English Channel to the North Sea, he takes the reader with him through the triumphant years of 1941 and 1942, when German U-boats nearly strangled England, to the apocalyptic final years of destruction, disillusionment, and defeat.</p><p>Herbert A Werner was born in 1920. He joined the German Navy in 1939, and the U-boats in 1941, taking up his first command in 1943. He survived the war, was interned by the Americans, British and French, eventually to become an American citizen in 1957."Page for page, one of the most exciting accounts of submarine warfare...First-rate." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Make-Believe Media: The Politics of Entertainment</h2><p>A classic &#34;Parenti text,&#34; this short volume explains film and television from a political perspective.</p><p>Having previously taken aim at, among other topics, American foreign policy (The Sword and the Dollar, 1988) and media propaganda techniques (Inventing Reality, 1986), veteran progressive critic Parenti now delivers a swift kick to the assumption that American mass entertainment, although vapid, remains basically harmless. Parenti argues that ``make-believe media'' promote belief in economic and political values that support a corrupt status quo (``images and themes that propagate private enterprise, consumerism, superpatriotism, imperialism, racial stereotyping, and sexism''). While readers may question many of the implicit concepts Parenti uses to measure media performance (belief in class struggle, etc.), his exploration of topics--from Rambo's influence on Reagan to the way the movies rewrote the civil-rights struggle to make the FBI the hero to how working people are systematically portrayed as crass--are likely to challenge them to ask exactly what they have been absorbing. Parenti argues that even the genre of horror flicks--King Kong and giant grasshoppers--had a subtext of encouraging public fear of swarthy Third World hoards and communist attack. Other chapters explain how children's programming now is a seamless web of shows about toys, how medical dramas and law-enforcement programs distort reality, and how ownership of media in ever-fewer hands leads to even tighter ideological control and suppression of diversity of opinion. Prickly analysis, peppered with the remains of neatly dissected cultural icons. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this well-written polemic, Parenti, whose previous book Inventing Reality: The Politics of the Mass Media ( LJ 1/86) lambasted the Fourth Estate, argues that the American entertainment industry promotes stereotypes and perpetuates Western, white male supremacy. Reviewing films and television programs from the 1930s ( Gunga Din ) to 1990 ( Pretty Woman ), he finds that even those films that attempt to explore minority characters and their motivations portray images of underlying ideals that reflect capitalist and individualistic values. Parenti also discusses the roles of film distribution and television censorship in making sure that "supply creates demand." This provocative work belongs in all types of libraries.

Barkley. Groundbreaking information is presented on the significant impairments produced by the disorder across major functional domains and life activities, including educational outcomes, work, relationships, health behaviors, and mental health. Thoughtfully considering the treatment implications of these findings, the book also demonstrates that existing diagnostic criteria do not accurately reflect the way ADHD is experienced by adults, and points the way toward developing better criteria that center on executive function deficits. Accessible tables, figures, and sidebars encapsulate the study results and methods.<p></p></p><p><p>Russell A.

Dr. Fischer served as coinvestigator and the Milwaukee site principal investigator on the longitudinal study reported in this volume.<p>"This energetic and informative book tackles head-on the knotty issue of what ADHD in adults really means. It includes helpful answers to such vital problems as what modifications to diagnostic criteria are appropriate, and what are the inferential biases to which clinicians are prone when seeing self-referred cases in their offices. This is the most definitive work to date on the difficult task of generalizing from children with ADHD to adults with ADHD. The authors break new ground in addressing these issues with comprehensive data from their own well-regarded samples. This timely book thus provides a fresh and needed perspective to help resolve longstanding difficulties in understanding ADHD in adults. It will be helpful to DSM-V committee deliberations and to those planning future scientific studies, as well as to clinicians needing a clearer picture of what to expect in adults with ADHD."--Joel T.

This work will be equally useful to researchers seeking innovative hypotheses about ADHD, to clinicians seeking to understand the course of ADHD into adulthood, and to students at all levels of training. Readers have access to a unified and systematic view of the results from two notable, methodologically rigorous research studies. The book addresses a wide range of clinically urgent issues, such as psychiatric comorbidity, drug use, life impairments, educational attainment, and neuropsychological impairment. The discussions of diagnostic criteria not only provide clinically useful information for adult assessment, but also should strongly influence the evolution of the DSM-V."--Stephen V.

An admired literary critic, she authored many essays, letters, journals, and short stories in addition to her groundbreaking novels.A posthumous collection of her essays, written over a twenty year period, but issued ten years after her Second Common Reader. For the most part, the essays fall into two classes slight, charming, almost idyllic bits of atmosphere writing; and critical essays, chiefly on figures of a period past (Coleridge, Sara Coleridge, Shelley, Henry James, George Moore and others). There are a few - a very few - more personal bits - one on the subject of her horror of being thought middlebrow - high??, yes, but never the other. Only one even touches on the war. Interesting to read immediately after the Forster Virginia Woolf, and to trace and check with him through a fresh approach to unread material.

But that promise has seldom been kept for low-income children of color in America. In <i>How the Other Half Learns</i>, teacher and education journalist Robert Pondiscio focuses on Success Academy, the network of controversial charter schools in New York City founded by Eva Moskowitz, who has created something unprecedented in American education: a way for large numbers of engaged and ambitious low-income families of color to get an education for their children that equals and even exceeds what wealthy families take for granted. Her results are astonishing, her methods unorthodox.<br><br>Decades of well-intended efforts to improve our schools and close the "achievement gap" have set equity and excellence at war with each other: If you are wealthy, with the means to pay private school tuition or move to an affluent community, you can get your child into an excellent school. But if you are poor and black or brown, you have to settle for "equity" and a lecture--about fairness. About the need to be patient. And about how school choice for you only damages public schools for everyone else. Thousands of parents have chosen Success Academy, and thousands more sit on waiting lists to get in. But Moskowitz herself admits Success Academy "is not for everyone," and this raises uncomfortable questions we'd rather not ask, let alone answer: What if the price of giving a first-rate education to children least likely to receive it means acknowledging that you can't do it for everyone? What if some problems are just too hard for schools alone to solve?</p><p><b>Robert Pondiscio</b> is senior fellow at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute and a former inner-city public school teacher.

Every time.<br>&nbsp;<br>After each classroom visit, Vandlik and her team huddle in the hallway, discuss what they&#x2019;ve just seen, and what to do about it. Next, they rehearse among themselves the feedback each teacher should get. One of the assistant principals goes back into the classroom and whispers advice or a correction in the teacher's ear. Changes are made immediately, in real-time, and without interrupting classroom instruction.<br>&nbsp;<br>The pattern repeats in room after room. After the walk-through, the school leadership team huddles to discuss both teachers and students who need their immediate attention.

It was a ten-year-old girl named Tiffany Lopez, a fifth-grader in my class during my second year of teaching at P.S. 277, a low-performing elementary school in the South Bronx.&nbsp; Walk into any classroom in any struggling urban school in America and you will spot a child like Tiffany almost immediately. Her eyes are always on the teacher, paying careful attention and following directions. She is bright and pleasant, happy to help and eager to please. Her desk is clean and well organized; her homework always neat and complete. She has grown up hearing every day how important education is. She believes it, and her behavior in class shows it. She does well in school. She gets praise and she gets good grades.<br>&nbsp;<br>She also gets screwed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since she goes to a school where most of her classmates read and do math well below grade level, Tiffany is &#x201c;not your problem,&#x201d; as an assistant principal pointedly told me, when I expressed concern about how little of my attention she was getting. The message to a new teacher could not have been clearer: focus your efforts on the low achievers, the disruptive, and the disengaged. Get them in the game. Tiffany will be fine.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since leaving the classroom, I have applied the &#x201c;Tiffany Test&#x201d; to any new education reform initiative, policy prescription, or innovative teaching idea: will this make it more likely or less likely that kids like Tiffany Lopez&#x2014;promising low-income children of color in places like the South Bronx&#x2014;will get what they need to reach their full academic and life potential? The answer rarely comes back in the affirmative. The broad thrust of education reform efforts, stretching back decades, has been aimed at closing achievement gaps between children of color and white and Asian children; between those who grow up in poverty and those who are more fortunate. The biggest losers in classrooms shaped by these well-intended policies are children like Tiffany. Children who are ready for new intellectual challenges pay a price when they sit in classrooms focused on their less proficient and less engaged peers. We can insist that the answer is &#x201c;differentiated instruction,&#x201d; personalized learning, or policies that valorize student &#x201c;growth&#x201d; over proficiency on standardized tests, making every student the teacher&#x2019;s problem, but these remedies are unsatisfying and na�ve, mere education homilies. If the vast majority of America&#x2019;s nearly four million teachers cannot easily and effectively implement your proposal, it is no solution at all. It fails the Tiffany Test. <br><br>When you have a Not Your Problem Child sitting in your class in the age of testing, accountability, and gap-closing you understand that despite her good grades and rock steady performance on state tests, she is subsisting on starvation rations in history, geography, science, art and music, the stuff that makes education interesting and engaging. Her finish line&#x2014;read on grade level; graduate on time&#x2014;is the starting line for more fortunate children, including your own. Tiffany and the numberless, faceless multitude of children like her, represents the low-hanging fruit the typical inner city school leaves dying on the vine. But she is maddeningly, damnably, <i>undemocratically </i>not your problem.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is a question that has gnawed at me ever since I was Tiffany Lopez&#x2019;s 5th grade teacher: If you are committed to equity and social justice, if you wish to keep faith with the American Dream, those who believe in it, and who view education as the indispensable engine of upward mobility, which is the more effective theory of change: should we attempt to serve all<br>disadvantaged children equally and labor to close achievement gaps because that is what&#x2019;s fair? Or should we ensure that receptive and motivated students are able to reap the full benefit of their talents and ambitions because that is what&#x2019;s just? The latter, of course, is what well-off families secure for their children effortlessly, either by paying tuition to opt out altogether from the public school system, or through their ability to buy their way into homes in affluent zip codes where their property taxes function as de facto tuition to excellent neighborhood schools.<br>&nbsp;<br>What might it look like -- what might America look like? -- if parents&#x2019; ability to steer their children into the best possible school setting was not a function of money and privilege, but something closer to the default setting for our public education system?<br>&nbsp;<br>Give a focused, low-income kid a superior education and you improve the odds that she is on the path to upward mobility, and that her children will not grow up in poverty. Give the same kid a bland, <i>good-enough </i>education and she is prepared mostly to march in place. A false dichotomy? Of course it is. The promise of American education is excellence for all. But that promise has seldom been kept if you are poor, black or brown. Worse, our humane and laudable efforts to increase educational <i>equity </i>have made educational excellence largely available only to those with the means to purchase it. Low-income black and brown children who are ready for greater intellectual challenges or who are simply buying what schools are selling? Not your problem.<br>&nbsp;<br>After leaving my classroom, Tiffany, with her rock-steady performance on state reading and math tests, continued her dutiful march onward and upward through the New York City school system, eventually moving out of state for high school, and graduating from a state university in <br><br>Pennsylvania. Given the long odds at birth against the child of a Hispanic single mother ever becoming a college graduate, she is an American success story. But I&#x2019;m haunted to this day by what I know the data cannot show. Tiffany Lopez was neglected by me, by other teachers, and by the systems we have created ostensibly to benefit children like her. And that neglect was not an accident, it was a policy. There is little doubt in my mind that had she attended my daughter&#x2019;s school, two subways stops and a world away on Manhattan&#x2019;s Upper East Side, she might have found her way to Harvard, Princeton, Stanford or any of the top-echelon<br>universities whose admissions office search and compete for students like her. From there, it&#x2019;s a shorter distance to diversifying the leadership class, America&#x2019;s ultimate achievement gap.<br>With her limitless grit and desire to learn, her deep investment in education, and the devoted support of her hard-working mother, Tiffany at age ten had as much upside potential as any kid in this country. With luck those natural gifts will fuel her rise for the next several decades. But if she becomes all that it was obvious she could be, sitting patient, alert, expectant, and ignored in my fifth grade classroom it will not be because of what I, and other teachers did for her.&nbsp; It will be in spite of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <b>&nbsp;<br></b><br>People who write about education and our decades-long attempts to improve it invariably bring their personal interests, experiences, and biases to the task. The reader deserves to know mine and something about the lens I brought to my year-long examination of Success Academy, the nation&#x2019;s most successful and controversial network of charter schools, and the lessons from it that we might apply to American education, particularly schools serving children growing up in poverty.<br>In 2002, I began working as a fifth-grade teacher in a low-performing South Bronx elementary school. My mid-career decision to become a public school teacher was closer to an impulse purchase than answering a call to service. It was the year I would turn 40. I was the father of a three-year-old daughter. I was working as the communications director for BusinessWeek magazine after serving in a similar capacity for TIME. The magazine industry had fallen out of bed, disrupted by the Internet and the bursting of the dot-com advertising bubble. In a little over a year, BusinessWeek went from running a record number of advertising pages to losing money for the first time since the Great Depression. I was ripe for the plucking a few months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks as I sat on the downtown N train home from Rockefeller Center across from an ad for the New York City Teaching Fellows, an &#x201c;alternative certification&#x201d; teacher preparation program aimed at luring mid-career professionals into hard-to-staff inner city public school classrooms. &#x201c;You remember your first grade teacher&#x2019;s name,&#x201d; read the ad across the subway aisle from me. &#x201c;Who will remember yours?&#x201d; <br><br>Fools rush in. I had been (and still am) a long-time board member of East Side House Settlement, a community-based organization in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx. Under its executive director, John Sanchez, the organization had evolved from providing cradle-to-grave social services to one with education at the core of its mission and programs.<br>Undoubtedly my involvement with East Side House softened the ground making me more receptive to the subway ad&#x2019;s pitch. It was through Sanchez&#x2019;s advice that I found myself one spring afternoon in the main office of PS 277, on St. Ann&#x2019;s Avenue and 148th Street, across the street from St. Mary&#x2019;s Park, asking to speak with the school principal, Carol Pertchik.<br><br>New York City Community School District 7 was, then and now, the lowest performing school district in New York City. P.S. 277 was the lowest performing school in District 7. But as I toured the building with Ms. Pertchik, I was struck by the relative calm in the classrooms I visited. When I told her I was hoping to teach 5th grade, typically the oldest, rowdiest, and hardest-to-staff year in most New York City elementary schools, she raised an eyebrow and offered me a job. I received six weeks of training from the New York City Department of Education, District 7, and the United Federation of Teachers, the teachers union. I taught summer school. In the fall, I was assigned to a 5th&nbsp; grade &#x201c;collaborative team teaching&#x201d; classroom, which serves both general and special education students in a single inclusive setting. While teaching, I attended required graduate school classes in elementary education as part of my Teaching Fellows training.<br><br>It was going to be a two-year, mid-career public service stint. But two years became five and education became my second career. Teaching is the easiest job in the world to do badly: If you wanted to phone it in, go through the motions, and head home at the end of your contractually obligated six hours and 20 minutes per day, you could get away with it forever&#x2014;particularly in a school like mine where I had only two formal observations in five years. But it&#x2019;s the hardest job to do well. Most days, to be blunt, it kicked my ass. Like every new teacher, I struggled with classroom management. There was no set curriculum and the techniques I was trained to use to teach reading, writing, and math bore little resemblance to what I remembered as a child. I was surprised at how little of my school&#x2019;s curriculum was codified in any way at all. My classroom was sloppy with people telling me how to teach, but when I asked <i>what </i>I should be teaching, the question was greeted with either amusement or dismissal. &#x201c;Mr. Pondiscio!&#x201d; a staff developer from the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project told me early in my career, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re the best person to know what your students need!&#x201d; I found that answer unhelpful, inscrutable, and almost certainly incorrect. I still do.&nbsp; I was in no position, then or now, to decide unilaterally what a ten-year-old in the South Bronx needed to know to become a well-educated, upwardly mobile, happily productive, and engaged citizen of the United States of America. <br><br>As a result of these experiences and frustrations, I became deeply interested in curriculum, which has guided much of my work since leaving the classroom. I became particularly persuaded by the work of E.D. Hirsch, Jr., the author of the Core Knowledge curriculum and the nonprofit foundation that publishes and promotes it.

This then serves as a starting point for a renewed understanding of modernity. Taylor argues that modern subjectivity has its roots in ideas of human good, and is in fact the result of our long efforts to define and attain the good. The modern turn inwards is far from being a disastrous rejection of rationality, as its critics contend, but has at its heart what Taylor calls the affirmation of ordinary life. He concludes that the modern identity, and its attendant rejection of an objective order of reason, is far richer in moral sources that its detractors allow. Sources of the Self provides a decisive defence of the modern order and a sharp rebuff to its critics.</p><p>In this inquiry into the sources of modern selfhood, Charles Taylor shows that the modern turn inward is not disastrous but is in fact the result of our long efforts to define and reach the good. At the heart of this definition he finds what he calls the affirmation of ordinary life, a value that has decisively if not completely replaced an older conception of reason as connected to a hierarchy based on birth and wealth.Charles Taylor is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy at McGill University.</p><h2>Happy Chinese (Kuaile Hanyu) 3: Student&#39;s Book</h2><p>KUAILE HANYU consists of six books with three levels, with both a student&#39;s book and teacher&#39;s book.

Abroad, it influenced the destinies of people everywhere. It divided Europe, split Germany, and engulfed the Third World. It led to a feverish arms race and massive sales of military equipment to poor nations. For at least four decades it left the world in a chronic state of tension where a miscalculation could trigger nuclear holocaust. </p> <p>Documents, oral histories, and memoirs illuminating the goals, motives, and fears of contemporary U.S. officials were already widely circulated and studied during the Cold War, but in the 1970s a massive declassification of documents from the Army, Navy, Air Force, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Department of Defense, and some intelligence agencies reinvigorated historical study of this war which became the definitive conflict of its time. While many historians used these records to explore specialized topics, this author marshals the considerable available evidence on behalf of an overall analysis of national security policy during the Truman years. To date, it is the most comprehensive history of that administration's progressive embroilment in the Cold War.</p></p><p>&#x201c;Magisterial . . . This book is without question a major achievement.

This revolutionary paper challenged certain basic assumptions underlying much research in mathematics and logic. G�del received public recognition of his work in 1951 when he was awarded the first Albert Einstein Award for achievement in the natural sciences&#x2014;perhaps the highest award of its kind in the United States. The award committee described his work in mathematical logic as "one of the greatest contributions to the sciences in recent times."</p> <p>However, few mathematicians of the time were equipped to understand the young scholar's complex proof. Ernest Nagel and James Newman provide a readable and accessible explanation to both scholars and non-specialists of the main ideas and broad implications of G�del's discovery. It offers every educated person with a taste for logic and philosophy the chance to understand a previously difficult and inaccessible subject.</p> <p>New York University Press is proud to publish this special edition of one of its bestselling books. With a new introduction by Douglas R. Hofstadter, this book will appeal students, scholars, and professionals in the fields of mathematics, computer science, logic and philosophy, and science.</p></p><p>G�del's incompleteness theorem--which showed that any robust mathematical system contains statements that are true yet unprovable within the system--is an anomaly in 20th-century mathematics. Its conclusions are as strange as they are profound, but, unlike other recent theorems of comparable importance, grasping the main steps of the proof requires little more than high school algebra and a bit of patience. Ernest Nagel and James Newman's original text was one of the first (and best) to bring G�del's ideas to a mass audience. With brevity and clarity, the volume described the historical context that made G�del's theorem so paradigm-shattering. Where the first edition fell down, however, was in the guts of the proof itself; the brevity that served so well in defining the problem made their rendering of G�del's solution so dense as to be nearly indigestible.<p> This reissuance of Nagel and Newman's classic has been vastly improved by the deft editing of Douglas Hofstadter, a prot�g� of Nagel's and himself a popularizer of G�del's work. In the second edition, Hofstadter reworks significant sections of the book, clarifying and correcting here, adding necessary detail there. In the few instances in which his writing diverges from the spirit of the original, it is to emphasize the interplay between formal mathematical deduction and meta-mathematical reasoning--a subject explored in greater depth in Hofstadter's other delightful writings. <i>--Clark Williams-Derry</i></p><p><b>Ernest Nagel</b> was John Dewey Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University.</p></p><h2>9 Heads: A Guide to Drawing Fashion.

This handsome retrospective catalog of his work, which includes his early representational paintings as well as his harmonic abstractions, has been published in conjunction with a major traveling exhibition of his work and contains more than 100 colorplates. Weiss has wisely placed the art before the commentary, allowing readers to absorb the quiet impact of Rothko's work before seeking explanations of the man and his still controversial creations in essays by Weiss, John Cage, Barbara Novak and Brian O'Doherty, and Carol Mancusi-Ungaro. Interviews with painters Ellsworth Kelly, Gerhard Richter, and Robert Ryman attest to Rothko's tremendous influence, and a detailed chronology tracks his rise to prominence, his steadily deteriorating health, and his suicide in 1970. Weiss' book succeeds in embracing the beauty, mystery, and sorrow of Rothko's vision. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Murder in the Museum (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>Mystery crime fiction written in the Golden Age of Murder</strong></p><p>When Professor Julius Arnell breathes his last in the hushed atmosphere of the British Museum Reading Room, it looks like death from natural causes.

He immigrated to the United States at age ten, taking with him his Talmudic education and his memories of pogroms and persecutions in Russia. His integration into American society began with a series of painful experiences, especially as a student at Yale, where he felt marginalized for his origins and ultimately left the school. The decision to become an artist led him to a new phase in his life. Early in his career, Annie Cohen-Solal writes, &#x201c;he became a major player in the social struggle of American artists, and his own metamorphosis benefited from the unique transformation of the U.S. art world during this time.&#x201d; Within a few decades, he had forged his definitive artistic signature, and most critics hailed him as a pioneer. The numerous museum shows that followed in major U.S. and European institutions ensured his celebrity. But this was not enough for Rothko, who continued to innovate. Ever faithful to his habit of confronting the establishment, he devoted the last decade of his life to cultivating his new conception of <i>art as an experience</i>, thanks to the commission of a radical project, the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas.<br><br> Cohen-Solal&#x2019;s fascinating biography, based on considerable archival research, tells the unlikely story of how a young immigrant from Dvinsk became a&nbsp;crucial transforming agent of the art world&#x2014;one whose legacy prevails to this day.</p><p><b>Annie Cohen-Solal</b>'s books include <i>Sartre: A Life </i>(a best-seller translated into sixteen languages), <i>Painting American</i> (Acad�mie des Beaux arts Prize), and<i> Leo &amp; His Circle: The Life of Leo Castelli</i> (ArtCurial Prize).&#x201c;Gripping . . . meticulous . . . this novelistic account is a rewarding close-up of Rothko&#x2019;s . . . experience as a Jewish immigrant.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly, </i>starred review (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Cohen-Solal's study of Mark Rothko is notable for her ability to link his strong Jewish ties to his changing, evolving art.

This book collects the entire printed output of these two important architects and archeologists of Roman architecture, four volumes condensed into one, and serves as the definitive edition on their work. <em>The Collected Works of Percier and Fontaine</em> is introduced by critic and historian Barry Bergdoll, and published in association with the Institute for Classical Art and Architecture.</p><p>Charles Percier (1764&#x2013;1838) and Pierre Fran�ois L�onard Fontaine (1762&#x2013;1853) were a highly influential pair of French architects and interior designers, credited with developing the neoclassical Empire style of design during the Napoleonic era.<br><br>Barry Bergdoll is Meyer Schapiro Professor of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University. He served as Philip Johnson Chief Curator at the Museum of Modern Art from 2007 to 2013. He has published widely on modern architectural history, and art history."Three folio volumes and a final double folio (all dating from 1798 to 1838) are compressed here into a quarto with fine-grained detail intact. The volume is intended for historians, architects, and others involved in, or who enjoy, traditional design. The plans and elevations facilitate same-scale comparisons, and some oblique views offer insight. The book covers large and small post-antique palaces and churches in Rome and elsewhere in Italy, in France, and a few in Germany, Russia, and Spain. Percier and Fontaine are most noted as Napoleon's architects, and they created many precisely engraved interiors and furnishings for him and others of the era. Few survive today, so these original renderings are welcome. Also welcome are the complete original layouts of villas and urban complexes that have subsequently been mauled or truncated. Included are several colored plates, the original publications' information about the buildings, and a useful introduction by Barry Bergdoll (Columbia Univ.). The book joins the canonic three-volume Edifices de Rome moderne, by Percier's student Paul Letarouilly (1840; published in English translation by Princeton Architectural Press in 1984), which has more post-antique Roman buildings and more extensive details. Summing Up: Highly recommended.

The appropriately imperial volume-gold lettering on a jet-black dust jacket-gathers together all Percier and Fontaine designs that were published between 1798 and 1812, engravings of tea tables, boiseries, friezes, beds, and ceilings that ravished Europe's sensibilities as swiftly as Napol�on's army invaded its countries..The 441-page book, part of Princeton Architectural Press's Classic Reprint Series and expertly scanned from originals, contains scores of engravings, beginning with Roman palaces and houses that the pair sketched on a youthful trip in the 1790s to a plan to revamp Paris's 17th-century Palais-Royal in 1829." - Architectural Digest Online<br>"The substantial and definitive tome pulls together four separate volumes, reproducing the pair's entire written output along with numerous extravagant illustrations.

Yet shy of fame and never one to steal the spotlight Armstrong was always reluctant to discuss his personal side of events. Here for the first time is the definitive story of Neil's life of flight he shared for five decades with a trusted friend - Jay Barbree.</p><p>Working from 50 years of conversations he had with Neil, from notes, interviews, NASA spaceflight transcripts, and remembrances of those Armstrong trusted, Barbree writes about Neil's three passions - flight, family, and friends. This is the inside story of Neil Armstrong from the time he flew combat missions in the Korean War and then flew a rocket plane called the X-15 to the edge of space, to when he saved his Gemini 8 by flying the first emergency return from Earth orbit and then flew Apollo-Eleven to the moon's Sea of Tranquility. </p><p>Together Neil and Jay discussed everything, from his love of flying, to the war years, and of course his time in space. The book is full of never-before-seen photos and personal details written down for the first time, including what Armstrong really felt when he took that first step on the moon, what life in NASA was like, his relationships with the other astronauts, and what he felt the future of space exploration should be.</p><p>As the only reporter to have covered all 166 American astronaut flights and moon landings Jay knows these events intimately. Neil Armstrong himself said, "Barbree is history's most experienced space journalist. He is exceptionally well qualified to recall and write the events and emotions of our time." Through his friendship with Neil and his dedicated research, Barbree brings us the most accurate account of his friend's life of flight, the book he planned for twenty years.</p></p><p>In the course of his 55-year career with NBC News, JAY BARBREE is the only reporter to have covered all 166 American astronaut flights and moon landings. He received an Emmy for his coverage of Neil Armstrong's first walk on the moon, broke the cause of the Challenger accident, and he still covers space for NBC's TV networks and NBCnews.com. Barbree was also the lead writer for the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Moon Shot</i> with astronauts Alan Shepard, Deke Slayton, and Neil Armstrong.<p>&#x201c;Much of Barbree's writing has a "you are there" immediacy, because he was present for many of the book's key events. During his more than half-century as space correspondent for NBC News, Barbree witnessed and reported on each and every launch of the U.S. human space program. He is at his best when describing the visceral thrill of rocket flight, the lifeless majesty of the moon, and the visual splendor of Earth from space. These poetic passages are made all the more poignant by his close brush with becoming an astronaut, as a finalist in NASA's failed-to-launch "Journalist in Space" program.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;Barbree's book reminds readers of all that led up to that first step.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Associated Press</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sit back, put up your feet, and spend some time with Neil Armstrong: A Life of Flight, by Jay Barbree, NBC's longtime space correspondent, who has covered the US manned spaceflight program for more than half a century. To be sure, this is not the definitive, footnote-packed Armstrong biography. Instead, this book has the feel of sitting down with Barbree at a barbeque for an extended conversation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Christian Science Monitor: 1of the 10 Best Books of July</i></p><p>&#x201c;NBC News space reporter Jay Barbree spent 50 years getting to know astronaut Neil Armstrong.

Space hounds and history buffs will dig it, for sure, but even casual readers will be riveted by its comprehensive portrait of a real-life cosmic cowboy who broke the bonds of Earth and put the first American footprint where it had never been before.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>American Profile</i></p><p>&#x201c;With a foreword by John Glenn NBC News space correspondent Barbree got very up-close to the former Navy combat pilot and astronaut, who died in 2012. Notoriously private, Armstrong opened up to the author to reveal his innermost thoughts, telling "what he really felt when he took that first step on the moon, and what life in NASA was like.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>VFW Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;Barbree's tone is warm, and he has a boyish enthusiasm for both tricky missions carried out deftly and for near misses barely avoided, both of which figure heavily in Armstrong's professional life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Columbus Dispatch</i></p><p>&#x201c;...intimate and definitive...a celebration of Armstrong's life and times.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</i></p><p>&#x201c;An eye-opening and entertaining tale of the race to the moon.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Veteran news correspondent Barbree offers an intimate view into the life of Neil Armstrong (1930-2012), his friend as well as a national hero and very private person.

He is the author of <i>Found on eBay: 101 Genuinely Bizarre Items from the World's Online Yard Sale</i>.From the bearded women and half-men of the P.T. Barnum era to the bug-eating denizens of contemporary Coney Island, Hartzman leaves no circus tent unexplored in his history of freakish sideshow performers. The human curiosities, many of whom made a good living, are listed alphabetically within each chronological section and are accompanied by brief bios-based on sensationalist publicity for the older cases, and interviews with those still living-that include everything from anatomical details and medical explanations to minutiae about performers' social lives: Myrtle Corbin, the four-legged woman, for instance, "had five children-three born from her own body, and two from her twin's." "Insectavora," Coney Island's resident facial-tattooed bug-eater, "walks up a razor-sharp ladder of swords and is currently working on a whip-cracking act. During the off-season she works in a tattoo and body-piercing shop, and probably eats a more balanced diet." Hartzman's book succeeds as a curiosity-quencher, but not as a reference, as his source material, particularly for the early performers, is sketchy, but the book-and its marvelous collection of photos-will shock and amaze offbeat voyeurs.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Geison uses Pasteur's laboratory notebooks, made available only recently, and his published papers to present a rich and full account of some of the most famous episodes in the history of science and their darker sides--for example, Pasteur's rush to develop the rabies vaccine and the human risks his haste entailed. The discrepancies between the public record and the "private science" of Louis Pasteur tell us as much about the man as they do about the highly competitive and political world he learned to master.</p><p>Although experimental ingenuity served Pasteur well, he also owed much of his success to the polemical virtuosity and political savvy that won him unprecedented financial support from the French state during the late nineteenth century. But a close look at his greatest achievements raises ethical issues. In the case of Pasteur's widely publicized anthrax vaccine, Geison reveals its initial defects and how Pasteur, in order to avoid embarrassment, secretly incorporated a rival colleague's findings to make his version of the vaccine work. Pasteur's premature decision to apply his rabies treatment to his first animal-bite victims raises even deeper questions and must be understood not only in terms of the ethics of human experimentation and scientific method, but also in light of Pasteur's shift from a biological theory of immunity to a chemical theory--similar to ones he had often disparaged when advanced by his competitors.</p><p>Through his vivid reconstruction of the professional rivalries as well as the national adulation that surrounded Pasteur, Geison places him in his wider cultural context. In giving Pasteur the close scrutiny his fame and achievements deserve, Geison's book offers compelling reading for anyone interested in the social and ethical dimensions of science.</p><p>Originally published in 1995.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

The discrepancies between the public record and the "private science" of Louis Pasteur tell us as much about the man as they do about the highly competitive and political world he learned to master.<p>"The most original account of Pasteur's science and his personality to appear. . . . a remarkable example of judicious, balanced scholarly treatment of very difficult issues. This book will be of great interest both within and outside the scholarly fields from which it emerges."<b>--Frederic L. Holmes, Yale University</b></p><p>"This book is a scientific biography at its best. With a fine sense of judgment, clear exposition, and the sophistication of the seasoned scholar, Professor Geison has produced a tour-de-force. Unswayed by the extremes of social construction or the prejudices of an animus against science, he has nevertheless revealed the nature of the Pastorian legend and has traced out the manner of its construction. Pasteur emerges still the skillful experimentalist, but also a bold combatant, versed in the art of oratory, and so secretive about his day-to-day work that until his laboratory notebooks became available recently it was impossible to check the myths that have made the legend."<b>--Robert Olby, University of Pittsburgh</b></p></p><h2>The Court Dancer: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>Set during the dramatic final years of the Korean Empire, the new novel from Man Asian Literary Prize winner Kyung-Sook Shin features a mysterious dancer caught up in the dizzying sweep of history.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Based on a remarkable true story, the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Please Look After Mom</em> brilliantly images the life of Yi Jin, an orphan who would fall under the affections of the Empress and become a jewel in the late Joseon Court.</p><p>When a novice French diplomat arrives for an audience with the Emperor, he is enraptured by the Joseon Dynasty&#x2019;s magnificent culture, then at its zenith. But all fades away when he sees Yi Jin perform the delicate traditional Dance of the Spring Oriole. Though well aware that women of the court belong to the palace, the young diplomat confesses his love to the Emperor, and gains permission for Yi Jin to accompany him back to France.</p><p>A world away in Belle Epoque Paris, Yi Jin lives a free, independent life, away from the gilded cage of the court, and begins translating and publishing Joseon literature into French with another Korean student. But even in this new world, great sorrow awaits her. Yi Jin&#x2019;s grieving and suffering is only amplified by homesickness and a longing for her oldest friend. But her homecoming was not a happy one. Betrayal, jealousy, and intrigue abound, culminating with the tragic assassination of the last Joseon empress&#x2015;and the poisoned pages of a book.</p><p>Rich with historic detail and filled with luminous characters, Korea&#x2019;s most beloved novelist brings a lost era to life in a story that will resonate long after the final page.&nbsp;</p></p><p><strong>Kyung-Sook Shin</strong> is one of South Korea&#x2019;s most widely read and acclaimed novelists. She is the author of <em>The Girl Who Wrote Loneliness, I'll Be Right There,&nbsp;</em>and <em>Please Look After Mom</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and a Man Asian Literary Prize winner.&#x201c;Inspired by the true story of a late-19th-century court dancer, Shin&#x2019;s novel explores themes of exoticism, assimilation and identity. By placing Korean history beside a Western narrative, Shin highlights the disparity between Europe and the more isolated Asian nation. At its core, <em>The Court Dancer</em> examines what countries lose in identity in exchange for technological advancement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A meditation on the social changes that force people to confront the double-edged swords of tradition and modernism. Shin is a distinctive and engaging writer whose work richly deserves a wide American audience.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New York Journal of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sorrow threads itself through the pages of <em>The Court Dancer</em>, yet there is a richness both to the period and the narrative as beautiful as any silk fan. Kyung-Sook Shin has become one of South Korea's most popular authors, and for good reason. Her deep understanding of the subtleties of the human heart effortlessly crosses borders and informs her portrait of a different place and a faraway time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>NPR</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A gorgeous epic that seamlessly combines history and fiction to create a hybrid masterpiece. The court dancer&#x2019;s latest journey west should command substantial, eager audiences.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating and lyrical portrayal of a woman and a country at the crossroads of history. Beautifully and evocatively written, the moving and ultimately tragic story of Yi Jin&#x2019;s life resonates like the melodic sound of the Korean flute and lingers hauntingly in your mind. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Historical Novels Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An absolute pleasure. Shin has shown us the heart of pre-modern Korea with all the heart and mind she herself always lends to her writing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Books and Bao</em></strong></p><h2>Theology and Practice of Mission: God, the Church, and the Nations</h2><p>Theology disconnected from mission is not Christian theology at all. The pastors, professors, and missionaries writing <i>Theology and Practice of Mission</i> provide a clear biblical-theological framework for understanding the church's mission to the nations. Toward that goal, the book holds three major sections: God's mission, the church's mission, and the church's mission to the nations.&nbsp;<br><br>Part one explores the canon of Christian Scripture from narrative and systematic angles, explaining how the mission of God-to redeem a people who will be a kingdom of priests to the praise of his glory, bear witness to his gospel, advance his church, and dwell with him forever on a new heaven and earth-is communicated in the Bible's four movements: Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Restoration.&nbsp;<br><br>Part two sees the mission of God's people in the light of God's mission, emphasizing not only preaching and church planting but also gospel witness in every dimension of human culture-glorifying God in family, church, work, community, through the arts, sciences, education, business, and the public square. The writers encourage us to live missionally, leaving all of our resources at God's disposal for the sake of his kingdom.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, part three contends that the North American church must come to terms with its missional calling-just as international missionaries do-and gives a starting point and parameters for conceiving the church's mission to all people groups and cultural contexts. Chapters here include ones on unreached people groups, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and Postmoderns.</p><p>Theology Disconnected From Mission is Not Christian Theology at All.<br><br>In order to build a biblical-theological framework for understanding God&#x2019;s mission, the church&#x2019;s mission, and the church&#x2019;s mission to the nations, one must first understand the unified biblical narrative, including its four major plot movements&#x2014;creation, fall, redemption, and restoration. It is with this in mind that the<br>contributors to Theology and Practice of Mission address some of the most compelling, practical, and crucial issues facing the global church today, issues such as justice, discipleship, community, and unreached people groups.<br><br>Faithfully addressing a comprehensive understanding of mission through the lens of those most directly involved and engaged&#x2014;God, the church, and the nations&#x2014;the contributors don&#x2019;t just establish the need for theory and practice to cooperate. They walk the reader, whether student, scholar, or practioner, through how that can be done to the glory of God no matter the context.<br><br>It is enormously encouraging to read a book on mission that consistently puts God and God&#x2019;s mission first, that applies the grand biblical framework of creation, fall, redemption and new creation thoroughly and repeatedly across almost every issue it addresses, and which tackles some very controversial areas with grace, wisdom, and biblical thoroughness. Here is a book that will richly reward all who patiently digest it, but will especially nourish teachers and practitioners of the mission that God has entrusted to His church.<br>&#x2013;Christopher J.

Chances are you weren&#x2019;t successful in shifting that person&#x2019;s beliefs in a significant way. For an endeavor so commonly mentioned and frequently attempted, why is the phenomenon of changing minds so mysterious? How do people become set on a certain way of thinking? And what, exactly, does it take to change that perspective? </p><p>In this groundbreaking book, world-renowned Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner offers surprising insights on this fascinating puzzle&#x2014;insights that could change the way we interact with others at work, at home, and in every aspect of our lives. Gardner, whose work over the last thirty years has revolutionized our thinking about intelligence, creativity, and leadership, now suggests that traditional thinking about mind change as a sudden "epiphany" is entirely wrong. Instead, Gardner shows, we change our minds gradually, in identifiable ways that can be actively and powerfully influenced. </p><p>Drawing on decades of cognitive research, Gardner identifies seven levers that aid or thwart the process of mind change, including reason, research, real-world events, and resistances. Changing Minds provides an original framework&#x2014;illustrated with famous and ordinary examples of "change agents" in politics, business, science, the arts, and everyday life&#x2014;that shows how individuals can align these levers to bring about significant changes in perspective and behavior. From Margaret Thatcher&#x2019;s reorientation of Great Britain to Sir John Browne&#x2019;s transformation of BP to Charles Darwin&#x2019;s evolutionary revolution to interactions between spouses or friends to decisions to change one&#x2019;s own mind, Gardner uncovers surprising similarities and instructive differences among the factors that affect mind change in a variety of settings. </p><p>Demystifying a phenomenon that permeates human behavior, Changing Minds provides insights that can broaden our horizons and improve our lives.</p>&#x201c;One of the leading psychologists of our times has taken on the single deepest question in the field: How and when do we change our minds?

Set in a south Texas border town, Mosquito is the story of her accidental and yet growing involvement in "the new underground railroad," a sanctuary movement for Mexican immigrants.<br>Mosquito's journey begins when she discovers Maria, a stowaway who nearly gives birth in the back of the truck; Maria will eventually name her baby Journal, a misspelled tribute to her unwitting benefactor Sojourner. Along the road, Mosquito introduces us to Delgadina, a Chicana bartender who fries cactus, writes haunting stories, and studies to become a detective - one of the most original and appealing characters in all of Jones's fiction. We also meet Monkey Bread, a childhood pal who is, improbably, assistant to a blonde star in Hollywood, where Mosquito pays her a memorable visit. As her understanding of the immigrants' need to forge new lives and identities deepens, so too does Mosquito's romance with Ray, a gentle revolutionary, philosopher, and, perhaps, a priest.</p><p>Depending on your tolerance for digression, Gayl Jones's <i>Mosquito</i> will either be hugely entertaining or absolutely crazy-making. The heroine and narrator of this hefty tome is Sojourner Jane Nadine Johnson--Mosquito, to her friends--an African American truck driver with a mind as flighty as the insect she's named for. You know what you're up against from the very first paragraph in which Mosquito expounds on Texas border towns, tanning products, cacti, a teacup shaped like a cactus, the town of Brownsville, and the Kiowa word for Brownsville (which she can't remember). All of this is delivered in lively dialect: "Am got a few of them cactus plants along Dairy Mart Road, though they ain't the archetypal cactus. I think it's Dairy Mart Road and some of that poverty grass. I guess it called poverty grass 'cause it the Southwest, you know. I'm going to have to find out the names of these grasses and plants and trees so's I can tell y'all what they is. I guess that's what I likes about the Southwest, though, the landscape. Well, I likes the people that I likes (the Perfectability Baptist Church would want me to say more about the likability of peoples and us commandments to love), but when you gets to the Southwest it got it own distinctive landscape." And obviously Sojourner Jane Nadine Johnson, a.k.a. Mosquito, has her own distinctive personality. <p> What sets the story rolling is Mosquito's discovery of a young pregnant Mexican woman in the back of her truck. Not surprisingly, it takes all of chapter 1 for her to actually <i>get</i> to this discovery as she is distracted numerous times by her mail, other people she's met along the road, a trip to an aquarium in Florida, and the relationship between yoga and yogurt--to name just a few of the many, <i>many</i> subjects she expounds upon before finally getting back around to the pregnant Mexican in the truck. From here on out, the novel concerns Mosquito's involvement in a "new underground railroad," a sanctuary movement for illegal immigrants. In addition to mother-to-be Maria, we meet Delgadina, a Chicana bartender and wannabe detective; Monkey Bread, a childhood friend; and Ray, a man Mosquito might just be willing to slow down for. What raises this novel above the merely picaresque is Jones's sophisticated political sensibility: as Mosquito makes her physical journey across the Southwest, she embarks on a cultural odyssey as well, examining the struggles of all the "second class peoples" to find a place for themselves in America. Letters, plays, poetry, and songs punctuate the narrative and Mosquito's distinctive voice always keeps the story "keepin' on." <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Gayl Jones has taught at Wellesley and the University of Michigan.</p><h2>Heaven and Earth: Making the Psychic Connection</h2><p>The famed medium and author of the best-selling Talking to Heaven explains how readers can develop their own innate psychic abilities, combining personal accounts of his spirit communications with a practical program for expanding one&#39;s intuition. 250,000 first printing.</p><p>Celebrity medium James Van Praagh has offered enormous comfort to the bereaved by helping them converse with their deceased loved ones.

He shows readers how to heighten each of their senses, not just the sixth one. In another chapter he describes the methods that spirits use to contact us, such as instilling thoughts that seem like "inspirations" (which mean "in spirit," according to Van Praagh). He also teaches readers how to protect themselves from negative entities, such as "psychic vampires." True to his bestselling formula in <i>Talking to Heaven</i> and <i>Reaching to Heaven</i>, Van Praagh uses real-life anecdotes to keep the narrative grounded and compelling. And there's an unexpected bonus: buried within the chapter "Psychic Protection," Van Praagh shares his clairvoyant insight into the assassination of John F.

Reissue.</p><p><p> <strong>FyodorDostoyevsky </strong>(18211881), one of nineteenth-century Russias greatest novelists, spent four years in a convict prison in Siberia, after which he was obliged to enlist in the army. In later years his penchant for gambling sent him deeply into debt. Most of his important works were written after 1864, including <strong>Notes from Underground</strong>, <strong>Crime and Punishment</strong>, <strong>The Idiot</strong>, and <strong>The Brothers Karamazov,</strong> all available from Penguin Classics.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Wealth of Nations</h2><p>While it has been pointed to time and again by governments and pundits promoting laissez-faire economics, the <em>Wealth of Nations</em> actually shows that Adam Smith viewed capitalism with a deep suspicion, and tempered his celebration of a self-regulating market with a darker vision of the dehumanizing potential of a profit-oriented society. Smith did not write an economics textbook, but rather a panoramic narrative about the struggle for individual liberty and general prosperity in history.<br> This edition includes generous selections from all five books of the <em>Wealth of Nations</em>. It also provides full notes and a commentary that places Smith's work within a rich interdisciplinary context.</p><p>Adam Smith&#39;s masterpiece, first published in 1776, is the foundation of modern economic thought and remains the single most important account of the rise of, and the principles behind, modern capitalism. Written in clear and incisive prose, The Wealth of Nations articulates the concepts indispensable to an understanding of contemporary society; and Robert Reich&#39;s new Introduction for this edition both clarifies Smith&#39;s analyses and illuminates his overall relevance to the world in which we live. As Reich writes, &#34;Smith&#39;s mind ranged over issues as fresh and topical today as they were in the late eighteenth century--jobs, wages, politics, government, trade, education, business, and ethics.&#34;"Adam Smith's enormous authority resides, in the end, in the same property that we discover in Marx: not in any ideology, but in an effort to see to the bottom of things."<br>--Robert L.

Written by what one might now describe as a Victorian Martha Stewart, the book offers advice on fashion, child-care, animal husbandry, poisons, and the management of servants. To the modern reader expecting stuffy verbosity or heavy moralizing, Beeton's book is a revelation: it explores the foods of Europe and beyond, suggesting new food stuffs and techniques, mixing domestic advice with discussions of science, religion, class, industrialism and gender roles. Alternately frugal and fashionable, anxious and self confident, the book highlights the concerns of the growing Victorian middle-class at a key moment in its history.

Here for the first time is a truly spiritual way of looking at fundraising as an opportunity to nurture current and prospective donors and facilitate their growth in faith. While the traditional focus of the fundraising process tends to be utilitarian before it is humane or spiritual, the empowering new model proposed here-fundraising as ministry-puts the humane and the spiritual first. It rests on the idea that relationships with donors should be built upon a desire to encourage their generosity and spiritual growth. This unusual and highly effective approach is rooted in the Gospel vision. It goes beyond respecting our neighbors to loving them. <p>Growing Givers' Hearts is based on the authors' in-depth study of seven successful Christian organizations whose fundraising efforts reveal the dynamic interplay between encouraging spiritual development of donors and raising essential resources. Such organizations share several key characteristics, including their assumption of God's abundant grace, their clear use of theology in the way they approach resource development, their practice of offering donors opportunities to participate in the ministry, and their ability to cultivate spiritually mature leadership.</p> <p>The book explores in detail these essential aspects of fundraising as ministry, giving readers a unique way to reflect on what they can do to make their work more personally satisfying and spiritually rewarding. Growing Givers' Hearts offers exceptional insights not only for development staff, but for executives, board members, and other leaders of Christian organizations across the theological spectrum.</p> <p><br> Based on a three-year, nationwide study of Christian organizations whose efforts are successful both in raising needed financial or material resources and in encouraging the spiritual development of their donors, this groundbreaking book identifies key characteristics that enable fundraising to function on both levels at once.

Wells to the press releases of NASA, we are awash in clich�d claims about high technology's ability to change the course of history. Now, in <em>The Shock of the Old</em>, David Edgerton offers a startling new and fresh way of thinking about the history of technology, radically revising our ideas about the interaction of technology and society in the past and in the present. He challenges us to view the history of technology in terms of what everyday people have actually used-and continue to use-rather than just sophisticated inventions. Indeed, many highly touted technologies, from the V-2 rocket to the Concorde jet, have been costly failures, while many mundane discoveries, like corrugated iron, become hugely important around the world. Edgerton reassesses the significance of such acclaimed inventions as the Pill and information technology, and underscores the continued importance of unheralded technology, debunking many notions about the implications of the "information age."

Her comprehensive survey shows compellingly how photography has sharpened, if not altered forever, our perception of the world.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The book was written to introduce students to photography. It does not require that students possess any technical know-how and can be taught without referring to techniques in photography. Incorporating the latest research and international uses of photography, the text surveys the history of photography in such a way that students can gauge the medium's long-term multifold developments and see the historical and intellectual contexts in which photographers lived and worked. It also provides a unique focus on contemporary photo-based work and electronic media. </p></p><p><p>The third edition of this groundbreaking survey of international photography has not only been expanded and brought up to date but restructured to offer readers even greater clarity and ease of use. It now comprises 14 shorter chapters each with an introduction and brief summary. Chapters are grouped into six Parts which begin with an introduction to the time period.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photography is examined through the lenses of art, science, social sciences, travel, war, fashion, the mass media, and individual practitioners. These broad topics complement a fully developed cultural context whose emphasis is more key ideas than individuals. The author has further enriched the third edition with the findings of the most recent research and exhibitions. These include fresh insights into Victorian photography&#x2019;s relationship to painting and to the expansion of the British Empire, as well as photography&#x2019;s involvement in German and Russian experimental art movements between the World Wars. The author also draws on publications that show the extent to which vernacular photography existed alongside art and commercial practice. &#x2018;Focus&#x2019; boxes highlight interesting cultural or controversial issues, for example &#x2018;Film and Photography&#x2019;, &#x2018;Photomontage or Photocollage&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Making an Icon of Revolution&#x2019;. In the revised final chapter, the author pays close attention to the impact of digital photography on photographic history and contemporary practice, particularly the ease and frequency with which people worldwide use digital cameras and camera phones.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to representing the canon of Europe and the United States, the book presents work from Latin America, Africa, India, Russia, China, and Japan. &#x2018;Portrait&#x2019; boxes feature certain photographers in greater detail and new to this edition are works by contemporary artists including Vik Muniz, Suzanne Opton, Tyler Hicks, Walid Raad, Anthony Goicolea, and Jean-Luc Mylayne.</p><p>Mary Warner Marien is a professor in the Department of Fine Arts at Syracuse University New York where she teaches courses on photographic history as well as on art criticism and its history. In 2008 she won an Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writer award for her continuing work on the history and theory of documentary photography and is the author of 'Photography and its Critics' (Cambridge University Press, 1997) as well as numerous articles on the history of photography.</p></p><h2>Microsoft Office 2013: Introductory (Shelly Cashman)</h2><p>Introduces your students to Microsoft Office.

Many of the country's most famous blueblood families?the closest thing we have to royalty?have lived and summered in Newport since the nineteenth century. The Astors, the Vanderbilts, Edith Wharton, JFK and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Doris Duke, and Claus and Sunny von Bulow are just a few of the many names who have called the city home. Gilded takes you along as you explore the fascinating heritage of the Newport elite, from its first colonists to the newest of its new millennium millionaires, showing the evolution of a town intent on living in its own world. Through a narrative filled with engrossing characters and lively tales of untold extravagance, Davis brings the resort to life and uncovers the difference between rich and Newport rich along the way.</p><ul><li>An engrossing multigenerational saga that tells the real story of the rich and famous in Newport</li><li>Vibrant, praiseworthy writing: ""[Davis] brings splendidly colorful behind-the-scenes action and players up front"" (the <i>New York Times</i> on Party of the Century)</li><li>34 evocative black-and-white photographs</li></ul><p>Written with insight and dramatic flair, Gilded gives you a rare peek into the cloistered coastal playground of America's moneyed elite.</p></p><p>There is rich&#x2014;and there is Newport rich. Home to the Astors, the Vanderbilts, and other superwealthy American aristocrats, Newport, Rhode Island, has been a storied playground, cloaked in legend and mystery. For generations, Newporters succeeded in separating those who did belong from those who desperately wanted to. Finally, <i>Gilded</i> opens the windows to its fabulous and irresistible world.<p>How did Newport become America's richest resort, surviving ups and downs for more than two hundred years to earn an enduring place in our imaginations? In this vibrant and colorful narrative, Deborah Davis reveals the answers as she explores the fascinating heritage of the Newport elite with extraordinary stories ranging from the island's first colonists to the newest of its new millennium millionaires.</p><p>In Newport, liveried servants once catered to every conceivable whim; ladies required 280 wardrobe changes during the eight-week summer season; sixty-room European-style "cottages" were the scene of countless opulent balls, lavish dinners, and formal teas; and fun was taken to such outrageous extremes that even monkeys and dogs might be honored dinner guests as long as they were properly attired. Davis lets you peer inside the magnificent 1880s world of the Mrs. Astor, who replaced Newport's casual entertainments with parties as sophisticated as those she hosted on Fifth Avenue, even building a ballroom big enough to accommodate her famous Four Hundred society insiders at Beechwood, her summertime perch on Bellevue Avenue. You'll see how the scheming of three determined socialites&#x2014;Mamie Fish, Alva Vanderbilt, and Tessie Oelrichs&#x2014;ousted Mrs. Astor from the top of the social pyramid and freed Newport from the constraints of her formal entertaining style.</p><p>Later, you'll read about the postwar dazzle of John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier's Newport wedding, the tragedy of Claus and Sonny von Bulow, and the ironic turn of events that gave tourists and other outsiders a central role in reversing the fortunes of Newport's fading mansions and helping to safeguard the island's vibrant history and heritage for years to come.</p><p>Based on dozens of revealing interviews with Newport insiders and including previously unpublished stories about the rich and famous, <i>Gilded</i> is a magnificent portrait of a uniquely American town. You have never read anything like it before.</p>Newport is the legendary and beautiful home of American aristocracy and the sheltered super&#x2013;rich.

In the midst of his anguish, he nevertheless "brought to his study of the crisis all the critical faculty and all the penetrating analysis of a first-rate historian" (<em>Christian Science Monitor</em>). Bloch takes a close look at the military failures he witnessed, examining why France was unable to respond to attack quickly and effectively. He gives a personal account of the battle of France, followed by a biting analysis of the generation between the wars. His harsh conclusion is that the immediate cause of the disaster was the utter incompetence of the High Command, but his analysis ranges broadly, appraising all the factors, social as well as military, which since 1870 had undermined French national solidarity.&nbsp;"Much has been, and will be, written in explanation of the defeat of France in 1940, but it seems unlikely that the truth of the matter will ever be more accurately and more vividly presented than in this statement of evidence." &#x2015; P.

Among other things, Python supports object-oriented programming; a remarkably simple, readable, and maintainable syntax; integration with C components; and a vast collection of pre-coded interfaces and utilities.As Python has grown to embrace developers on a number of different platforms (Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac), companies have taken notice and are adopting Python for their products. It has shown up animating the latest Star Wars movie, serving up maps and directories on the Internet, guiding users through Linux installations, testing chips and boards, managing Internet discussion forums, scripting online games, and even scripting wireless products.<i>Programming Python</i> is the most comprehensive resource for advanced Python programmers available today. Reviewed and endorsed by Python creator Guido van Rossum, who also provides the foreword, this book zeroes in on real-world Python applications. It's been updated for Python 2.0 and covers Internet scripting, systems programming, Tkinter GUIs, C integration domains, and new Python tools and applications. Among them: IDLE, JYthon, Active Scripting and COM extensions, Zope, PSP server pages, restricted execution mode, the HTMLgen and SWIG code generators, thread support, CGI and Internet protocol modules. Such applications are the heart and soul of this second edition.Veteran O'Reilly author Mark Lutz has included a platform-neutral CD-ROM with book examples and various Python-related packages, including the full Python 2.0 source code distribution.</p></p><p>Completely revised and improved, the second edition of <i>Programming Python</i> is an excellent compendium of material geared toward the more knowledgeable Python developer. It includes dozens of reusable scripts for common scripting tasks, and is one of the best available sources of information for this popular object-oriented scripting language.<p> In over 1,200 pages of material, this book offers an extremely comprehensive guide to Python development. Though his book is densely packed with information, Mark Lutz is a lively and witty writer whose focus is on getting things done using the natural strengths of the Python language. To that end, after an introduction and history of the language, the book shows how to use Python for performing automated tasks with files and directories (for example, for doing backups both locally and on Web servers). Not only will this book teach you more about Python, but it will also give you a library of code that you can use as is or adapt for your own projects.</p><p> The text covers every conceivable facet of Python and the language's support for networking, files and directories, task management, and even persistence (through its support for <i>shelves</i>). Complete Python programs show how to create e-mail clients, do reporting, and create Web applications (for an online errata database). Chapters on doing graphics programming in Python, as well as coverage of both built-in and custom data structures, are especially good. Because Python is often used for automating installations (in some Linux distributions, for instance), readers will appreciate the sample code and tips for using Python to create bulletproof installs.</p><p> Later sections show how get Python to work with C, Java (through <i>JPython</i>), and other languages. The book concludes with useful reference sections summarizing key aspects of Python, like its revision history, relationship to C++, and other material. There aren't many titles on Python, and fans of this up-and-coming language are lucky to have such a solid tutorial and guide available in <i>Programming Python</i>. Perfect for those with just a little previous exposure to the language, it's all you need to master Python in-depth and tap its considerable power for virtually any software project. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered:</b> </p><ul><li>Introduction to Python </li><li>Basic system scripts with Python (including file and directory tools) </li><li>Working with processes and threads </li><li>Pipes and signals </li><li>Sample scripts for system and Web utilities (including backing up files, program launching, replicating and managing directories) </li><li>Graphical user interface design in Python (including the <i>Tkinter</i> module) </li><li>Widgets and basic components </li><li>Layout options </li><li>Event handling </li><li>GUI examples (including a working text editor, image viewer, and clock) </li><li>Network scripting (sockets, FTP, and e-mail clients) </li><li>Server-side scripting </li><li>Sample server scripts for an online errata database </li><li>Python on the Internet (including Zope, JPython, and XML tools) </li><li>Databases and persistence in Python (including <i>pickled</i> objects and <i>shelf</i> files) </li><li>Custom and built-in data structures in Python </li><li>Text and string handling </li><li>C integration with Python (including the SWIG module) </li><li>Embedding Python calls within C </li><li>Hints for using Python in real projects </li><li>Reference to recent changes to Python </li><li>Python vs. C++ quick-start guide</li></ul><p>Mark Lutz is an independent Python trainer, writer, and software developer, and is one of the primary figures in the Python community.

It is an original interpretation of Spiritualism that does far more than recount the narrow history of a single movement.

They fell in love. They took their honeymoon on bicycles. They expanded the periodic table, discovering two new elements with startling properties, radium and polonium. They recognized radioactivity as an atomic property, heralding the dawn of a new scientific era. They won the Nobel Prize. Newspapers mythologized the couple's romance, beginning articles on the Curies with "Once upon a time . . . " Then, in 1906, Pierre was killed in a freak accident. Marie continued their work alone. She won a second Nobel Prize in 1911, and fell in love again, this time with the married physicist Paul Langevin. Scandal ensued. Duels were fought.</p><p>In the century since the Curies began their work, we've struggled with nuclear weapons proliferation, debated the role of radiation in medical treatment, and pondered nuclear energy as a solution to climate change.

This book takes advantage of that fact, using recreational mathematics &#x2014; problems, puzzles and games &#x2014; to teach students how to think critically. Encouraging active participation rather than just observation, the book focuses less on mathematical results than on how these results can be applied to thinking about problems and solving them. <br>Each chapter contains a diverse array of problems in such areas as logic, number and graph theory, two-player games of strategy, solitaire games and puzzles, and much more. Sample problems (solved in the text) whet readers' appetites and motivate discussions; practice problems solidify their grasp of mathematical ideas; and exercises challenge them, fostering problem-solving ability. Appendixes contain information on basic algebraic techniques and mathematical inductions, and other helpful addenda include hints and solutions, plus answers to selected problems.

(Short Circuits)</h2><p><p><b>A militant Marxist atheist and a &#x201c;Radical Orthodox&#x201d; Christian theologian square off on everything from the meaning of theology and Christ to the war machine of corporate mafia.</b></p><p>&#x201c;What matters is not so much that &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek is endorsing a demythologized, disenchanted Christianity without transcendence, as that he is offering in the end (despite what he sometimes claims) a heterodox version of Christian belief.&#x201d;&#x2015;John Milbank</p><p>&#x201c;To put it even more bluntly, my claim is that it is Milbank who is effectively guilty of heterodoxy, ultimately of a regression to paganism: in my atheism, I am more Christian than Milbank.&#x201d;&#x2015;Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek</p><p>In this corner, philosopher Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek, a militant atheist who represents the critical-materialist stance against religion's illusions; in the other corner, &#x201c;Radical Orthodox&#x201d; theologian John Milbank, an influential and provocative thinker who argues that theology is the only foundation upon which knowledge, politics, and ethics can stand. In <i>The Monstrosity of Christ</i>, &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek and Milbank go head to head for three rounds, employing an impressive arsenal of moves to advance their positions and press their respective advantages. By the closing bell, they have not only proven themselves worthy adversaries, they have shown that faith and reason are not simply and intractably opposed. &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek has long been interested in the emancipatory potential offered by Christian theology. And Milbank, seeing global capitalism as the new century's greatest ethical challenge, has pushed his own ontology in more political and materialist directions. Their debate in <i>The Monstrosity of Christ</i> concerns the future of religion, secularity, and political hope in light of a monsterful event&#x2015;God becoming human. For the first time since &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek's turn toward theology, we have a true debate between an atheist and a theologian about the very meaning of theology, Christ, the Church, the Holy Ghost, Universality, and the foundations of logic. The result goes far beyond the popularized atheist/theist point/counterpoint of recent books by Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, and others. &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek begins, and Milbank answers, countering dialectics with &#x201c;paradox.&#x201d; The debate centers on the nature of and relation between paradox and parallax, between analogy and dialectics, between transcendent glory and liberation. Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek is a philosopher and cultural critic. He has published over thirty books, including <i>Looking Awry</i>, <i>The Puppet and the Dwarf</i>, and <i>The Parallax View</i> (these three published by the MIT Press). John Milbank is an influential Christian theologian and the author of<i> Theology and Social Theory: Beyond Secular Reason</i> and other books. Creston Davis, who conceived of this encounter, studied under both &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek and Milbank.</p></p><p>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek, a philosopher and cultural critic, is Senior Researcher in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London. He is the author of more than thirty books, including <i>Looking Awry: An Introduction to Jacques Lacan through Popular Culture</i>, <i>The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity</i>, <i>The Parallax View</i>, T<i>he Monstrosity of Christ: Paradox or Dialectic </i>(with John Milbank), and <i>&#x17d;i&#x17e;ek's Jokes (Did you hear the one about Hegel and negation?)</i>, these five published by the MIT Press."In this dazzling dialogue, Zizek and Milbank change words and cross swords, until the point where both recognize that Christ and Hegel, in their monstrosity, look very much alike. A phenomenal achievement!"--Catherine Malabou, Maitre de Conferences, Philosophy Department, Universite Paris-X Nanterre<br><br>"The contemporary return to the theological most dramatically occurs in this book, as Zizek fully realizes his earlier Hegelian and Lacanian theological work, a work that Milbank can essentially know as a uniquely modern expression of nihilism. Nonetheless Milbank enters into a genuine theological dialogue with this nihilism, and a truly new theological discourse occurs. This effects a paradoxical union between orthodoxy and heterodoxy, and between radical orthodoxy and radical heterodoxy, which is perhaps the deepest motif of the contemporary return to the theological."--Thomas J. J. Altizer, author of "Godhead and the Nothing"</p><h2>Hamlet (Simply Shakespeare)</h2><p>This tale of the immortal Prince of Denmark delves deeply into the complexities of the human soul as it recounts Hamlet's tragic struggle to avenge his father's death. Books in this new, illustrated series present complete texts of Shakespeare's plays. However, the lines are set up so students can see the bard's original poetic phrases printed side-by-side and line-by-line with a modern "translation" on the facing page. <br><br>Starting in the late 1580s and for several decades that followed, Shakespeare's plays were popular entertainment for London's theatergoers. His Globe Theatre was the equivalent of a Broadway theater in today's New York. The plays have endured, but over the course of 400+ years, the English language has changed in many ways&#x2014;which is why today's students often find Shakespeare's idiom difficult to comprehend. <br><br><i>Simply Shakespeare</i> offers an excellent solution to their problem. Introducing each play is a general essay covering Shakespeare's life and times. At the beginning of each of the five acts in every play, a two-page spread describes what is about to take place. The story's background is explained, followed by brief descriptions of key people who will appear in the act, details students should watch for as the story unfolds, discussion of the play's historical context, how the play was staged in Shakespeare's day, and explanation of puns and plays on words that occur in characters' dialogues. <br><br>Identifying icons preceding each of these study points are printed in a second color, then are located again as cross-references in the play's original text. For instance, where words spoken by a person in the play offer insights into his or another character's personality, the "Characters" icon will appear as a cross-reference in both the introductory spread and the play proper. Following each act, a closing spread presents questions and discussion points for use as teachers' aids. <br><br>Guided by the inspiring format of this fine new series, both teachers and students will come to understand and appreciate the genius of Shakespeare as never before.</p><p>This edition tells the story of Hamlet in production, from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society. The detailed stage history records an ongoing process of discovery, as successive performers have found what it is in the play that will speak most powerfully to the audiences of their own times. The introduction focuses not only on star Hamlets, but on whole productions of the play including supporting players and, in this century, direction and design.This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics.</p><h2>Cannery Row (Penguin Drop Caps)</h2><p>It all begins with a letter.

Henry the painter sorts through junk lots for pieces of wood to incorporate into the boat he is building, while the girls from Dora Flood&#x2019;s bordello venture out now and then to enjoy a bit of sunshine. Lee Chong stocks his grocery with almost anything a man could want, and Doc, a young marine biologist who ministers to sick puppies and unhappy souls, unexpectedly finds true love. Cannery Row is just a few blocks long, but the story it harbors is suffused with warmth, understanding, and a great fund of human values. First published in 1945, and drawn from Steinbeck's memories of real inhabitants of Monterey, California,&nbsp;<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;focuses on the acceptance of life as it is&#x2014;both&nbsp;the loneliness of the individual and&nbsp;the exuberance of community.</p><p><b>John Steinbeck</b> (1902&#x2013;1968) was born in Salinas, California.

In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <i>Cup of Gold</i> (1929). After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California fictions, <i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> (1932) and <i>To a God Unknown</i> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <i>The Long Valley</i> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <i>Tortilla Flat</i> (1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <i>In Dubious Battle</i> (1936), <i>Of Mice and Men</i> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> (1939). Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <i>The Forgotten Village</i> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <i>Sea of Cortez</i> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing <i>Bombs Away</i> (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <i>The Moon Is Down</i> (1942). <i>Cannery Row</i> (1945), <i>The Wayward Bus</i> (1947), <i>The Pearl</i> (1947), <i>A Russian Journal</i> (1948), another experimental drama, <i>Burning Bright</i> (1950), and <i>The Log from the</i> Sea of Cortez (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <i>East of Eden</i> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history. The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <i>Sweet Thursday</i> (1954), <i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i> (1957), <i>Once There Was a War</i> (1958), <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> (1961), <i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i> (1962), <i>America and Americans</i> (1966), and the posthumously published <i>Journal of a Novel: The</i> East of Eden <i>Letters</i> (1969), <i>Viva Zapata!</i> (1975), <i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i> (1976), and <i>Working Days: The Journals of</i> The Grapes of Wrath (1989). He died in 1968, having won a Nobel Prize in 1962.</p><p>Throughout his life Steinbeck signed his letters with his personal &#x201c;Pigasus&#x201d; logo, symbolizing himself &#x201c;a lumbering soul but trying to fly.&#x201d; The Latin motto <i>Ad Astra Per Alia Porci</i> translates &#x201c;To the stars on the wings of a pig.&#x201d;</p><p>JOHN STEINBECK CENTENNIAL EDITION (1902-2002)</p><p><b>JOHN STEINBECK</b></p><p><b>Cannery Row</b></p><p>Table of Contents</p><p><b><i>Cannery Row</i></b></p><p>Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses. Its inhabitants are, as the man once said, &#x201c;whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches,&#x201d; by which he meant Everybody. Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, &#x201c;Saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,&#x201d; and he would have meant the same thing.</p><p>In the morning when the sardine fleet has made a catch, the purse-seiners waddle heavily into the bay blowing their whistles. The deep-laden boats pull in against the coast where the canneries dip their tails into the bay. The figure is advisedly chosen, for if the canneries dipped their mouths into the bay the canned sardines which emerge from the other end would be metaphorically, at least, even more horrifying. Then cannery whistles scream and all over the town men and women scramble into their clothes and come running down to the Row to go to work. Then shining cars bring the upper classes down: superintendents, accountants, owners who disappear into offices. Then from the town pour Wops and Chinamen and Polaks, men and women in trousers and rubber coats and oilcloth aprons. They come running to clean and cut and pack and cook and can the fish. The whole street rumbles and groans and screams and rattles while the silver rivers offish pour in out of the boats and the boats rise higher and higher in the water until they are empty. The canneries rumble and rattle and squeak until the last fish is cleaned and cut and cooked and canned and then the whistles scream again and the dripping, smelly, tired Wops and Chinamen and Polaks, men and women, straggle out and droop their ways up the hill into the town and Cannery Row becomes itself again&#x2014;quiet and magical. Its normal life returns. The bums who retired in disgust under the black cypress tree come out to sit on the rusty pipes in the vacant lot. The girls from Dora&#x2019;s emerge for a bit of sun if there is any. Doc strolls from the Western Biological Laboratory and crosses the street to Lee Chong&#x2019;s grocery for two quarts of beer. Henri the painter noses like an Airedale through the junk in the grass-grown lot for some part or piece of wood or metal he needs for the boat he is building. Then the darkness edges in and the street light comes on in front of Dora&#x2019;s&#x2014;the lamp which makes perpetual moonlight in Cannery Row. Callers arrive at Western Biological to see Doc, and he crosses the street to Lee Chong&#x2019;s for five quarts of beer.</p><p>How can the poem and the stink and the grating noise&#x2014;the quality of light, the tone, the habit and the dream&#x2014;be set down alive? When you collect marine animals there are certain flat worms so delicate that they are almost impossible to capture whole, for they break and tatter under the touch. You must let them ooze and crawl of their own will onto a knife blade and then lift them gently into your bottle of sea water. And perhaps that might be the way to write this book&#x2014;to open the page and to let the stories crawl in by themselves.</p><p><b>1</b></p><p>Lee Chong&#x2019;s grocery, while not a model of neatness, was a miracle of supply. It was small and crowded but within its single room a man could find everything he needed or wanted to live and to be happy&#x2014;clothes, food, both fresh and canned, liquor, tobacco, fishing equipment, machinery, boats, cordage, caps, pork chops. You could buy at Lee Chong&#x2019;s a pair of slippers, a silk kimono, a quarter pint of whiskey and a cigar. You could work out combinations to fit almost any mood. The one commodity Lee Chong did not keep could be had across the lot at Dora&#x2019;s.</p><p>The grocery opened at dawn and did not close until the last wandering vagrant dime had been spent or retired for the night. Not that Lee Chong was avaricious. He wasn&#x2019;t, but if one wanted to spend money, he was available. Lee&#x2019;s position in the community surprised him as much as he could be surprised. Over the course of the years everyone in Cannery Row owed him money. He never pressed his clients, but when the bill became too large, Lee cut off credit. Rather than walk into the town up the hill, the client usually paid or tried to.</p><p>Lee was round-faced and courteous. He spoke a stately English without ever using the letter R. When the tong wars were going on in California, it happened now and then that Lee found a price on his head. Then he would go secretly to San Francisco and enter a hospital until the trouble blew over. What he did with his money, no one ever knew. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t get it. Maybe his wealth was entirely in unpaid bills. But he lived well and he had the respect of all his neighbors. He trusted his clients until further trust became ridiculous. Sometimes he made business errors, but even these he turned to advantage in good will if in no other way. It was that way with the Palace Flophouse and Grill. Anyone but Lee Chong would have considered the transaction a total loss.</p><p>Lee Chong&#x2019;s station in the grocery was behind the cigar counter. The cash register was then on his left and the abacus on his right. Inside the glass case were the brown cigars, the cigarettes, the Bull Durham, the Duke&#x2019;s mixture, the Five Brothers, while behind him in racks on the wall were the pints, half pints and quarters of Old Green River, Old Town House, Old Colonel, and the favorite&#x2014;Old Tennessee, a blended whiskey guaranteed four months old, very cheap and known in the neighborhood as Old Tennis Shoes. Lee Chong did not stand between the whiskey and the customer without reason. Some very practical minds had on occasion tried to divert his attention to another part of the store. Cousins, nephews, sons and daughters-in-law waited on the rest of the store, but Lee never left the cigar counter. The top of the glass was his desk. His fat delicate hands rested on the glass, the fingers moving like small restless sausages. A broad golden wedding ring on the middle finger of his left hand was his only jewelry and with it he silently tapped on the rubber change mat from which the little rubber tits had long been worn. Lee&#x2019;s mouth was full and benevolent and the flash of gold when he smiled was rich and warm. He wore half-glasses and since he looked at everything through them, he had to tilt his head back to see in the distance. Interest and discounts, addition, subtraction he worked out on the abacus with his little restless sausage fingers, and his brown friendly eyes roved over the grocery and his teeth flashed at the customers.</p><p>On an evening when he stood in his place on a pad of newspaper to keep his feet warm, he contemplated with humor and sadness a business deal that had been consummated that afternoon and reconsummated later that same afternoon. When you leave the grocery, if you walk catty-cornered across the grass-grown lot, threading your way among the great rusty pipes thrown out of the canneries, you will see a path worn in the weeds. Follow it past the cypress tree, across the railroad track, up a chicken walk with cleats, and you will come to a long low building which for a long time was used as a storage place for fish meal. It was just a great big roofed room and it belonged to a worried gentleman named Horace Abbeville. Horace had two wives and six children and over a period of years he had managed through pleading and persuasion to build a grocery debt second to none in Monterey. That afternoon he had come into the grocery and his sensitive tired face had flinched at the shadow of sternness that crossed Lee&#x2019;s face. Lee&#x2019;s fat finger tapped the rubber mat. Horace laid his hands palm up on the cigar counter. &#x201c;I guess I owe you plenty dough,&#x201d; he said simply.</p><p>Lee&#x2019;s teeth flashed up in appreciation of an approach so different from any he had ever heard. He nodded gravely, but he waited for the trick to develop.</p><p>Horace wet his lips with his tongue, a good job from corner to corner. &#x201c;I hate to have my kids with that hanging over them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why, I bet you wouldn&#x2019;t let them have a pack of spearmint now.&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong&#x2019;s face agreed with this conclusion. &#x201c;Plenty dough,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Horace continued, &#x201c;You know that place of mine across the track up there where the fish meal is.&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong nodded. It was his fish meal.</p><p>Horace said earnestly, &#x201c;If I was to give you that place&#x2014;would it clear me up with you?&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong tilted his head back and stared at Horace through his half-glasses while his mind flicked among accounts and his right hand moved restlessly to the abacus. He considered the construction which was flimsy and the lot which might be valuable if a cannery ever wanted to expand. &#x201c;Shu,&#x201d; said Lee Chong.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, get out the accounts and I&#x2019;ll make you a bill of sale on that place.&#x201d; Horace seemed in a hurry.</p><p>&#x201c;No need papers,&#x201d; said Lee. &#x201c;I make paid-in-full paper.&#x201d;</p><p>They finished the deal with dignity and Lee Chong threw in a quarter pint of Old Tennis Shoes. And then Horace Abbeville walking very straight went across the lot and past the cypress tree and across the track and up the chicken walk and into the building that had been his, and he shot himself on a heap of fish meal. And although it has nothing to do with this story, no Abbeville child, no matter who its mother was, knew the lack of a stick of spearmint ever afterward.</p><p>But to get back to the evening. Horace was on the trestles with the embalming needles in him, and his two wives were sitting on the steps of his house with their arms about each other (they were good friends until after the funeral, and then they divided up the children and never spoke to each other again). Lee Chong stood in back of the cigar counter and his nice brown eyes were turned inward on a calm and eternal Chinese sorrow. He knew he could not have helped it, but he wished he might have known and perhaps tried to help. It was deeply a part of Lee&#x2019;s kindness and understanding that man&#x2019;s right to kill himself is inviolable, but sometimes a friend can make it unnecessary. Lee had already underwritten the funeral and sent a wash basket of groceries to the stricken families.</p><p>Now Lee Chong owned the Abbeville building&#x2014;a good roof, a good floor, two windows and a door. True it was piled high with fish meal and the smell of it was delicate and penetrating. Lee Chong considered it as a storehouse for groceries, as a kind of warehouse, but he gave that up on second thought. It was too far away and anyone can go in through a window. He was tapping the rubber mat with his gold ring and considering the problem when the door opened and Mack came in. Mack was the elder, leader, mentor, and to a small extent the exploiter of a little group of men who had in common no families, no money, and no ambitions beyond food, drink, and contentment. But whereas most men in their search for contentment destroy themselves and fall wearily short of their targets, Mack and his friends approached contentment casually, quietly, and absorbed it gently. Mack and Hazel, a young man of great strength, Eddie who filled in as a bartender at La Ida, Hughie and Jones who occasionally collected frogs and cats for Western Biological, were currently living in those large rusty pipes in the lot next to Lee Chong&#x2019;s. That is, they lived in the pipes when it was damp but in fine weather they lived in the shadow of the black cypress tree at the top of the lot. The limbs folded down and made a canopy under which a man could lie and look out at the flow and vitality of Cannery Row.</p><p>Lee Chong stiffened ever so slightly when Mack came in and his eyes glanced quickly about the store to make sure that Eddie or Hazel or Hughie or Jones had not come in too and drifted away among the groceries.</p><p>Mack laid out his cards with a winning honesty. &#x201c;Lee,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I and Eddie and the rest heard you own the Abbeville place.&#x201d;</p><p>Lee Chong nodded and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;I and my friends thought we&#x2019;d ast you if we could move in there. We&#x2019;ll keep up the property,&#x201d; he added quickly. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t let anybody break in or hurt anything. Kids might knock out the windows, you know&#x2014;&#x201d; Mack suggested. &#x201c;Place might burn down i...</p></p><h2>Understanding Dying, Death, and Bereavement</h2><p>Using a social-psychological approach, the new edition of this book remains solidly grounded in theory and research, while also providing useful information to help individuals examine their own feelings about-and cope with-death and grieving. The well-known authors and researchers integrate stimulating personal accounts throughout the text, and apply concepts to specific examples that deal with cross cultural perspectives and the practical matters of death and dying.</p><p>Michael R.

I would say that this book takes a multidisciplinary approach to the study of death and dying, presenting a comprehensive review of key topics and issues in the field. The authors manage to cover the personal, social, cultural, legal, philosophical, spiritual, and ethical issues related to death and dying against the backdrop of empirical research and theory in the field. In addition to presenting basic facts and information, the authors offer practical advice that enables readers to understand and to cope with the problems and issues that arise in a world where death, dying, and bereavement are a reality."<br><br>"I have used this book several times and have not found one that is as comprehensive or offers the cross cultural insights. I selected it because not only was it substantive, but it also introduced students to cross-cultural variations.

Southerners are more likely to support Republican candidates, gun rights, and the death penalty, and southern whites harbor higher levels of racial resentment than whites in other parts of the country. Why haven't these sentiments evolved or changed? <i>Deep Roots</i> shows that the entrenched political and racial views of contemporary white southerners are a direct consequence of the region's slaveholding history, which continues to shape economic, political, and social spheres. Today, southern whites who live in areas once reliant on slavery&#x2015;compared to areas that were not&#x2015;are more racially hostile and less amenable to policies that could promote black progress.&nbsp;</p><p>Highlighting the connection between historical institutions and contemporary political attitudes, the authors explore the period following the Civil War when elite whites in former bastions of slavery had political and economic incentives to encourage the development of anti-black laws and practices. <i>Deep Roots</i> shows that these forces created a local political culture steeped in racial prejudice, and that these viewpoints have been passed down over generations, from parents to children and via communities, through a process called behavioral path dependence. While legislation such as the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act made huge strides in increasing economic opportunity and reducing educational disparities, southern slavery has had a profound, lasting, and self-reinforcing influence on regional and national politics that can still be felt today.</p><p>A groundbreaking look at the ways institutions of the past continue to sway attitudes of the present, <i>Deep Roots</i> demonstrates how social beliefs persist long after the formal policies that created those beliefs have been eradicated.</p></p><p><p>"In this major new interpretation of southern politics, Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen provide important evidence demonstrating that present-day racial and partisan cleavages among southern whites can be traced directly back to the legacy of slavery. The authors&#x2019; skillful use of a wide range of data sources offers rich insights into the connections between historical institutions and contemporary political attitudes."<b>--Eric Schickler, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"Presenting a compelling explanation for why areas of the American South have been left behind, <i>Deep Roots</i> is a salutary challenge to those of us who complacently celebrate changes wrought in the region since the 1960s. A must-read for those who seek to understand the modern South."<b>--Anthony J. Badger, author of <i>FDR: The First Hundred Days</i></b></p><p>"<i>Deep Roots</i> provocatively argues that the shock of emancipation and its aftermath triggered broad social and political changes in parts of the American South that were most heavily dependent on cotton production, and therefore needing cheap labor. Those areas today remain the most racially conservative among southern whites, with continuing political effects. This is a gripping book."<b>--David O. Sears, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"This book conveys a powerful message: the influence of chattel slavery is deeply--but variably--embedded in the contemporary political landscape of the American South. Communities where slavery once flourished now are especially conservative, hostile to African Americans, and opposed to race-based policies. Communities with weaker ties to slavery, by contrast, look very different today. Written by a first-rate team of scholars, <i>Deep Roots</i> is a model of theoretically informed historical scholarship."<b>--William Howell, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"As our nation confronts the continuing role of white supremacy, <i>Deep Roots</i> argues that slavery was not only a peculiar institution, it was also a persistent one, its effects reverberating over time. This convincing and carefully researched book shows that contemporary political orientations in the white South are rooted in the political geography of slavery, its political economy, and its evolving system of racial domination. <i>Deep Roots</i> represents a defining moment in the field of American politics."<b>--Vesla Mae Weaver, coauthor of <i>Arresting Citizenship</i></b></p><p>"A seminal look at how America&#x2019;s extractive past has fundamentally determined its current politics. <i>Deep Roots</i> will resonate with what you know and reshape how you think."<b>--James Robinson, University of Chicago</b></p><p> "This book's arguments can't be right, can they? But the authors bring evidence to bear so well that they have knocked the ball back into the skeptics' court. <i>Deep Roots </i>will be enormously productive in advancing knowledge--it is what we want books to be."<b>--Robert Mickey, author of <i>Paths Out of Dixie</i></b></p><b>Avidit Acharya</b> is assistant professor of political science at Stanford University. <b>Matthew Blackwell</b> is assistant professor of government at Harvard University. <b>Maya Sen</b> is associate professor of public policy at the John F.

The Noreen solution presents integrated and proven solutions designed to help attain course goals of student readiness, comprehension of content, and application of key concepts in the managerial accounting course, while addressing the needs of instructors who <strong>do not wish to teach the financial accounting-oriented content that is included in the Garrison solution (no debits/credits)</strong>. Of the three programs in the Garrison franchise (the Brewer solution, the Garrison solution, and the Noreen solution), the <strong>Noreen</strong> solution <strong>is the most pure management accounting content</strong>. The other two programs contain greater coverage of financial accounting topics.<p><em>Managerial Accounting for Managers</em>&nbsp;4e is geared towards professors who love Garrison&#x2019;s market-leading managerial accounting content but prefer to approach their course by eliminating the debits and credits coverage.

Furthermore, the chapters dealing with process costing, the statement of cash flows, and financial statement analysis have been dropped to enable professors to focus their attention on the bedrocks of managerial accounting&#x2015;planning, control, and decision making.</p><p> McGraw-Hill&#x2019;s <em>Connect Accounting</em> offers a complete digital solution combines all the great features of <em>Connect Accounting </em>including&nbsp;McGraw-Hill&#x2019;s SmartBook, powered by LearnSmart, which is designed to help students learn faster and more efficiently, and retain more knowledge for greater success.

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; <i>Great Ethics</i> (<i>Magna Moralia</i>); <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>; <i>Politics</i>; <i>Oeconomica</i> (on the good of the family); <i>Virtues and Vices</i>.<br>II. Logical: <i>Categories</i>; <i>On Interpretation</i>; <i>Analytics</i> (<i>Prior</i> and <i>Posterior</i>); <i>On Sophistical Refutations</i>; <i>Topica</i>.<br>III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc.<br>IV. <i>Metaphysics</i>: on being as being.<br>V. On Art: <i>Art of Rhetoric</i> and <i>Poetics</i>.<br>VI. Other works including the <i>Athenian Constitution</i>; more works also of doubtful authorship.<br>VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.The Loeb Classical Library� edition of Aristotle is in twenty-three volumes.</p></p><p><p>Philip Henry Wicksteed (1844&#x2013;1927) was a Unitarian minister and Lecturer in Economics at the University of London.</p><p>Francis Macdonald Cornford (1874&#x2013;1943) was Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy at the University of Cambridge.</p></p><h2>The Moral Domain: Guided Readings in Philosophical and Literary Texts</h2><p>This engaging, interactive and pedagogical introduction to ethics combines the best features of a textbook and an anthology. <em>The Moral Domain: Guided Readings in Philosophical and Literary Texts</em> contains numerous readings from key philosophical writings in ethics along with captivating literary selections that bring the ethical issues to life. Offering extensive excerpts from major figures in the history of Western ethics--Aquinas, Aristotle, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Mill and Plato--the book also integrates work from non-Western perspectives, including selections from the Bhagavad Gita, Confucian views and Hsun-Tzu. It also represents women's voices with readings by Julia Annas, Sarah Broadie, Carol Gilligan, Martha Nussbaum and others. Literary selections--including work from the Bible, Camus, Dostoevsky, Golding, Sophocles, Tolstoy, Twain and Wharton--enable students to grasp deep ethical concepts at an intuitive level.<br><br><em>The Moral Domain</em> features a unique built-in study guide that helps students to better comprehend and interact with the material. It introduces each selection with orienting questions and then intersperses explanations, commentary and study questions (designed to test comprehension and provoke reflection) throughout the readings. Each chapter includes a "Further Discussion and Applications" section that demonstrates how ethical theory affects such contemporary moral debates and problems as abortion, euthanasia, feminism, hunger, warfare and more. An exemplary text for introduction to ethics and moral philosophy courses, <em>The Moral Domain</em> provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to all facets of ethics; its foundations, history, debates and current real-life controversies.<br></p><p>Norman Lillegard is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Tennessee at Martin.<br>"<em>The Moral Domain</em> stands out from most [texts] in its rich, enticing and lively textual explication. By organizing the chapters along themes, Lillegard allows the reader to span the chronology, to watch an ethical concern or claim develop from some early attempt by an ancient scholar to be revised in the medieval period and criticized and applied by more contemporary scholars. The relevant content is very well explained and backed up by a solid selection of seminal readings, occasionally supported by literary or biblical texts. Students really appreciate literary pieces, which bring the philosophical concerns alive."--Christina M. Bellon, <em>California State University, Sacramento</em><p></p><br>"The selection of interspersed works of literature gives students the opportunity to see the issues in terms of compelling stories that both capture their interest and provoke them to think. The literature makes the ideas 'real' for them. I think the questions interspersed with the text are particularly well done, getting at important points, being provocative of thought, and aimed adeptly at the students' interests."--Glen A. Mazis, <em>Penn State Harrisburg</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Earth System History</h2><p>Steve Stanley was the first author to write an historical geology textbook with whole-earth approach to the subject.

STANLEY, John Hopkins University, USA.</p><h2>Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions</h2><p>From handshakes and toasts to chant and genuflection, ritual pervades our social interactions and religious practices. Still, few of us could identify all of our daily and festal ritual behaviors, much less explain them to an outsider. Similarly, because of the variety of activities that qualify as ritual and their many contradictory yet, in many ways, equally legitimate interpretations, ritual seems to elude any systematic historical and comparative scrutiny. In this book, Catherine Bell offers a practical introduction to ritual practice and its study; she surveys the most influential theories of religion and ritual, the major categories of ritual activity, and the key debates that have shaped our understanding of ritualism. Bell refuses to nail down ritual with any one definition or understanding. Instead, her purpose is to reveal how definitions emerge and evolve and to help us become more familiar with the interplay of tradition, exigency, and self-expression that goes into constructing this complex social medium.</p><p>Catherine Bell is at Santa Clara University, California.<br>"Certainly the most ambitious and comprehensive introduction to ritual studies yet attempted....[it] will serve well as a text on the study of religion and ought not be consigned to courses focusing exclusively or even mainly on ritual."--<em>Religious Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"A rich and detailed interdisciplinary analysis of the nature and functions of ritual. Scholars in all fields will profit from this sound and probing study."--<em>Religious Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"A very impressive achievement....[Bell's] is one of the most interesting and important voices in the field of ritual studies today."--<em>Worship</em><p></p><br>"Unrivalled for its combination of clarity, scope, and originality. ...a touchstone for any scholar who wishes to write seriously on ritual."--Patrick J. Nugent, Earlham College<p></p><br>"...this is a readable introduction that will no doubt serve as a valuable teaching resource....the author has provided an impressive and valuable study, one that serves a widespread need in the broader field of religious studies, and for that reason is highly recommended."--<em>Journal of Religion</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Physical Universe</h2><p><i>The Physical Universe</i>, 16e by Konrad Krauskopf and Arthur Beiser is an outstanding text with a long history that has been updated and given a fresh look.

He then earned a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of California in Berkeley. When the Great Depression made jobs in chemistry scarce, Professor Krauskopf decided to study geology, which had long fascinated him. Through additional graduate work at Stanford University, he earned a second Ph.D. and eventually a position on the Stanford faculty. He remained at Stanford until his retirement in 1976. During his tenure, Professor Krauskopf also worked at various times with the U.S. Geological Survey, served with the U.S. army in occupied Japan, and traveled to Norway, France, and Germany on sabbatical leaves. His research interests included field work on granites and metamorphic rocks and laboratory study on applications of chemistry to geologic problems, especially the formation of ore deposits. In recent years, Professor Krauskopf had spent time working with various government agencies on the problem of radioactive waste disposal. Professor Krauskopf passed away on May 8, 2003.<br><br>Arthur Beiser, a native of New York City, received B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in physics from New York University, where he later served as Associate Professor of Physics. He then was a Senior Research Scientist at the Lamont Geo- logical Observatory of Columbia University. His research interests were chiefly in cosmic rays and in magnetohydrodynamics as applied to geophysics and astrophys- ics. In addition to theoretical work, he participated in a cosmic-ray expedition to an Alaskan peak and directed a search for magnetohydrodynamic waves from space in various Pacific locations. A Fellow of The Explorers Club, Dr. Beiser was the first chairman of its Committee on Space Exploration. He is the author or coauthor of 36 books, mostly college texts on physics and mathematics, 14 of which have been translated into a total of 27 languages. Two of his books are on sailing, The Proper Yacht and The Sailor&#x2019;s World. Figure 13-21 is a photograph of Dr. Beiser at the helm of his 58-ft sloop; he and his wife Germaine have sailed over 150,000 miles, includ- ing two Atlantic crossings and a rounding of Cape Horn.

A. Wallis Budge. Budge presents a history of Egyptian magic and the details of its practice to help you uncover the Egyptian's distinction between white magic and black magic as you learn about magical artifacts, their identities and their applications in detail. These include jeweled scarabs and amulets, shown alongside useful illustrations and an abundance of information.

How did beliefs that predated the worship of deities come to become associated with controlling gods and goddesses? How did magical amulets ward off evil spirits? What role did scarabs serve in bestowing immortality? <p> The writings of E.A. Wallis Budge are considered somewhat controversial today because of his use of an archaic system of translation, but useful illustrations and an abundance of information make them necessary works for students of ancient civilizations as well as those of the evolution of historical study. This entertaining overview of the connection between religion and magic in ancient Egypt remain a vital resource today.</p><p><b>Sir E. A. Wallis Budge</b> (1857-1934) was a noted English Egyptologist. He worked for the British Museum during the era of Victorian fascination in ancient cultures and wrote numerous books on Egypt, including the important work, <i>The Egyptian Book of the Dead.</i>&nbsp;On behalf of the British Museum, Budge traveled to Egypt and Sudan numerous times to acquire antiquities, many of which continue to reside at the Museum. His acquisitions and writing helped to bring Egyptology to a wider audience, and they continue to resonate today. In 1920, Budge was knighted for his work of bringing Egyptology to the masses, and to the British Museum. He retired from the museum in 1924, and died ten years later. In his will, he established a scholarship for intrepid young minds at both the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford to continue his work in Egyptology.</p></p><h2>The Wheelwright&#39;s Shop (Canto original series)</h2><p>George Sturt&#39;s frank and moving account of his trade as a wheelwright in the late nineteenth century offers a unique glimpse into the working lives of craftsmen in a world since banished by technology. The wheelwright&#39;s shop where he entered business had been operating for two centuries; this chronicle, first published in 1923, is a poignant record of that tradition, written as it was passing into history.

Stach's riveting narrative, which reflects the latest findings about Kafka's life and works, draws readers in with nearly cinematic precision, zooming in for extreme close-ups of Kafka's personal life, then pulling back for panoramic shots of a wider world blighted by World War I, disease, and inflation.</p><p> In these years, Kafka was spared military service at the front, yet his work as a civil servant brought him into chilling proximity with its grim realities. He was witness to unspeakable misery, lost the financial security he had been counting on to lead the life of a writer, and remained captive for years in his hometown of Prague. The outbreak of tuberculosis and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire constituted a double shock for Kafka, and made him agonizingly aware of his increasing rootlessness. He began to pose broader existential questions, and his writing grew terser and more reflective, from the parable-like <i>Country Doctor</i> stories and <i>A Hunger Artist</i> to <i>The Castle</i>.</p><p> A door seemed to open in the form of a passionate relationship with the Czech journalist Milena Jesensk�. But the romance was unfulfilled and Kafka, an incurably ill German Jew with a Czech passport, continued to suffer. However, his predicament only sharpened his perceptiveness, and the final period of his life became the years of insight.</p></p><p><p>"Stach pursues what can be known of Kafka so far and so exhaustively. . . .

Stach has a connection to and familiarity with his subject that no other biographer can match. He gives us a real understanding of the ground from which Kafka's writings emerged--what he was reading, which lectures and concerts he was attending, who he was talking with and writing to, and what he was saying to himself when he was writing. Closer we cannot get.

I. Finley in his classic work. The states of the ancient Mediterranean world had no recognizable real-property market, never fought a commercially inspired war, witnessed no drive to capital formation, and assigned the management of many substantial enterprises to slaves and ex-slaves. In short, to study the economies of the ancient world, one must begin by discarding many premises that seemed self-evident before Finley showed that they were useless or misleading. Available again, with a new foreword by Ian Morris, these sagacious, fertile, and occasionally combative essays are just as electrifying today as when Finley first wrote them.</p><p>"<i>The Ancient Economy</i> holds pride of place among the handful of genuinely influential works of ancient history. This is Finley at the height of his remarkable powers and in his finest role as historical iconoclast and intellectual provocateur. It should be required reading for every student of pre-modern modes of production, exchange, and consumption."&#x2014;Josiah Ober, author of <i>Political Dissent in Democratic Athens</i><b>M. I.

It opens with Langston Hughes's <i><b>Not Without Laughter</b></i> (1931), an elegantly realized coming-of-age tale that follows a young man from his rural origins to the big city. Suffused with childhood memories, it is the poet's only novel. George S. Schuyler's <i><b>Black No More</b></i> (1931), a satire founded on the science fiction premise of a wonder drug permitting blacks to change their race, skewers public figures white and black alike in a raucous, carnivalesque send-up of American racial attitudes. Considered the first detective story by an African American writer, Rudolph Fisher's <i><b>The Conjure-Man Dies</b></i> (1932) is a mystery that comically mixes and reverses stereotypes, placing a Harvard-educated African "conjureman" at the center of a phantasmagoric charade of deaths and disappearances. <i><b>Black Thunder</b></i> (1936), Arna Bontemps's stirring fictional recreation of Gabriel Prosser's 1800 slave revolt, which, though unsuccessful, shook Jefferson's Virginia to its core, marks a turn from aestheticism toward political militancy in its exploration of African American history.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

It's already happening in innovative undertakings, such as ET, a call center business in India where at least 60 percent of the employees call themselves Christians. Modeling biblical principles and recognized for its world-class level of service, this successful company has created jobs, built a profitable business, strengthened the local church and seen people decide to follow Jesus. <p>In God Is at Work, Ken Eldred examines how God is transforming people and nations through companies like ET amidst an emerging missions movement called "Kingdom business." Challenging the view that capitalism and biblical principles cannot coexist, Kingdom business is achieving economic and spiritual transformation around the globe and is welcomed even by developing nations that are traditionally closed to the gospel. This unprecedented book gives a comprehensive overview of Kingdom business, its objectives and approaches. Ken Eldred's personal experience, as well as other Kingdom business efforts around the world, highlights this integrated missions movement, a unique combination of missions, successful business practices and economic development. </p><p>Learn how leaders of developing nations around the world, some of whom are Muslims, are inviting Christian business leaders to come into their countries and bring needed spiritual capital and business principles to create greater economic opportunities for their people. Discover the role of Kingdom business professionals in advising, funding and operating for-profit enterprises of varying sizes and types. See what happens when God is at work giving individuals the opportunity to participate with Him in Kingdom business, one of the greatest missions endeavors of the twenty-first century. </p><p>The opportunities to advance the cause of Christ have never been greater.

It took two months for news to reach San Francisco, where it was greeted with skepticism. Several months later, a man waved a bottle of gold dust and shouted, "Gold! Gold from the American River!" and San Francisco caught gold fever. Crewmen abandoned ships in the harbor and went off in search of gold. Teachers left their classrooms to head for the golden hills. Within a month, the California Star newspaper reported that seaports, towns and ranches all over the state had "become suddenly drained of human beings."<br> <br> I believe the opportunity in Kingdom business is every bit as exciting as the Gold Rush! In many ways, I feel like one of the early pioneers in California&#x2019;s Gold Country, recounting exciting discoveries, telling of wonderful opportunities, and providing a map for others who wish to come. In particular, this book provides the following:<br> � Some foundational groundwork that addresses the language, definition, theology, historical perspective, structure and promise of Kingdom business<br> � Exciting examples of diverse Kingdom business ventures that are advancing the church all over the developing world<br> � A framework for understanding how Kingdom business is becoming a major missions thrust of the Church<br> � Guidance for Christians who are interested in participating in and supporting Kingdom business efforts worldwide<br> � A lexicon of terminology and a structure for Kingdom business in order to stimulate further thinking, research and discussion<br> <br> Seizing the Opportunity<br> Businessmen and women are people of action. As entrepreneurs, they charge full speed ahead, seizing on business or ministry needs and objectives. Successful shoe salesman Dwight L. Moody became a great nineteenth-century evangelist, and hard-charging entrepreneur Bill Bright went on to found Campus Crusade for Christ. Sensing a specific spiritual need, these men used skills honed in the business world to establish successful ministries.<br> <br> Today, a growing number of business people who are every bit as committed to the Great Commission (see Matt. 28:19-20) are taking a slightly different approach. Unlike Moody and Bright, they are opting to remain in the business arena. They are using commerce and business development themselves as vehicles for blessing a people and bringing the gospel of Jesus. The approaches are varied, as are the needs that are being met. Some sense the vision of enabling the poor to engage in small entrepreneurial ventures. Others are seeking to create jobs by assisting and growing small- and medium-size businesses. Yet others are involved in operating larger ventures that have the potential to influence entire cities and industries.<br> <br> Clearly, Kingdom business is a major opportunity, and the key will be the response of the Church. We can fight it&#x2015;or we can see the opportunity in it. Perhaps more than any other missions movement, effective Kingdom business requires support and involvement from a wide range of members of the Body of Christ. It is my prayer that as you read this book, you consider how God might use your gifts, training and passion to advance His Kingdom through business.</p><h2>Snowman - Cold = Puddle: Spring Equations</h2><p><b>Poetry + Math + Science = A new way of looking at spring</b><br><br>Math meets metaphor in this eye-opening exploration of spring.

The result of a collaboration by two of the era&#39;s most important writers, this book represents their attempt to direct women&#39;s acquisition and use of a dizzying variety of new household consumer goods available in the post-Civil War economic boom. It updates Catharine Beecher&#39;s influential Treatise on Domestic Economy (1841) and incorporates domestic writings by Harriet Beecher Stowe first published in The Atlantic in the 1860s. Today, the book can be likened to an anthology of household hints, with articles on cooking, decorating, housekeeping, child-rearing, hygiene, gardening, etiquette, and home amusements. The American Woman&#39;s Home, almost a bible on domestic topics for Victorian women, illuminates women&#39;s roles a century and a half ago and can be used for comparison with modern theories on the role of women in the home and in society.

It tells us about the infinite reaches of space, the tiniest living organism, the human body, the history of Earth. People have always been doing science because they have always wanted to make sense of the world and harness its power. From ancient Greek philosophers through Einstein and Watson and Crick to the computer-assisted scientists of today, men and women have wondered, examined, experimented, calculated, and sometimes made discoveries so earthshaking that people understood the world&#x2014;or themselves&#x2014;in an entirely new way.</p><p>This inviting book tells a great adventure story: the history of science. It takes readers to the stars through the telescope, as the sun replaces the earth at the center of our universe. It delves beneath the surface of the planet, charts the evolution of chemistry's periodic table, introduces the physics that explain electricity, gravity, and the structure of atoms. It recounts the scientific quest that revealed the DNA molecule and opened unimagined new vistas for exploration.</p><p>Emphasizing surprising and personal stories of scientists both famous and unsung, <i>A Little History of Science </i>traces the march of science through the centuries. The book opens a window on the exciting and unpredictable nature of scientific activity and describes the uproar that may ensue when scientific findings challenge established ideas. With delightful illustrations and a warm, accessible style, this is a volume for young and old to treasure together.</p></p><p><p>A Conversation with William Bynum</p><p><i>Q: Why did you write this book?</i></p><p>A: I was charmed by Gombrich's <i>Little History of the World</i> and thought I would like to do something like it for my grandchildren Alex and Peter. I used to teach the history of science and thought what a wonderful story it could make, to start at the beginning with the stargazers in Babylon and come up to the computer age of today. People from time immemorial, in all cultures, have thought about such things as why the sun rises and sets, how a hen's egg develops into a new chick, and why we fall ill and might be made well.</p><p><i>Q: What are the great turning points&#x2014;for you&#x2014;in the history of science?</i></p><p>A: The invention of the telescope and the microscope, which allowed people to do science on things that you couldn't even see with your naked eye.</p><p>Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, which changed the way we see the living world and offered us the chance to delve into the secrets of life. Einstein's theories of relativity, which opened up the universe to new interpretations.</p><p>The coming of the modern computer, which enabled scientists to tackle questions in fields as diverse as the human genome and climate change that would have been impossible a couple of generations ago.</p><p><i>Q: What are the major themes of your book? </i></p><p>A: My book has only one theme: science as a human endeavor to understand the world. The history of science is a journey through time, illuminated on the way by great thinkers, adept experimenters, and people of enlarged curiosity. Understanding that journey tells us something about who we are as human beings.</p><p><b>William Bynum</b> is&nbsp;professor emeritus, history of medicine, University College London.

Attributed by the ancients to Homer, these <i>prooimia</i>, or preludes, were actually composed over centuries and used by poets to prepare for the singing or recitation of longer portions of the Homeric epics. In his acclaimed translations of the hymns, Apostolos Athanassakis preserves the essential simplicity of the original Greek, offering a straightforward, line-by-line translation that makes no attempts to masquerade or modernize. For this long-awaited new edition, Athanassakis enhances his classic work with a comprehensive index, careful and selective changes in the translations themselves, and numerous additions to the notes which will enrich the reader's experience of these ancient and influential poems.</p></p><p><p>A course paperback bestseller -- more than 75,000 copies in print</p><p><b>Apostolos N.

She knows that it can be overwhelming and cause you to lose yourself and doubt who you are. With this guide for anyone who&#x2019;s ever felt out of place because of their sensitivity, Red Feather offers advice on how to manage life&#x2019;s difficulties as an empath as well as insight into how these qualities are vitally important to the future of humanity. <br><br>Affirming that being an empath is a real thing and you are not alone in your experience of the world, Red Feather offers practical exercises to help you understand, control, and fully manifest your gifts. She explains how to clear your energy field, stop energy leaks, and reclaim your sense of self. She warns of the pitfalls of being an empath, such as employing your gifts in unhealthy ways, and stresses the importance of embracing both the Divine Masculine, to create boundaries and safety, as well as the Divine Feminine, to practice radical self-care and live authentically from your own center. <br><br>Red Feather explains not only that there are now more empaths than ever before, but that this surge in numbers is no coincidence. With the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, empaths represent the new human blueprint. They are the way-showers for the next step in human evolution, and they have a cosmic mission: to usher in a higher level of human consciousness, centered in the heart chakra. Red Feather also explains the impending reactivation of dormant levels of consciousness and cosmic memory, which will upgrade our human operating systems to function at a higher frequency. This shift is already acutely felt by empaths and will allow us to reclaim the lost powers of our ancestors. <br><br>With this hands-on guide, Red Feather provides empaths the tools they need to empower themselves and embrace their essential role in the next step of humanity&#x2019;s evolution and ascension into the frequency of heart-centered consciousness.</p><p>Rev.

Your Energy Container: "Shields Up Mr. Sulu"</b> <br><i>Understanding Your Energy Container <br><br></i>Quite simply, you are more than just your physical being. You have a field of energy that surrounds you: your personal energy field. It is unique to you, just like a fingerprint or a snowflake pattern. Basic physiology teaches us that each cell in our body has a charge. The very fact that you are alive--from electrical impulses traveling throughout your body to your cells converting food to energy--creates an energy field. <br><br>Yet your energy field is comprised of more than just the byproducts of human biological functioning. Thoughts and actions also have a frequency to them. Everything you are, think, and do contributes to the distinct frequency or vibration that is you and your unique energetic signature. You have probably already surmised that as empaths it is much easier for us to be boundless and it requires much more effort and focus for us to establish and maintain boundaries. <br><br>You would be correct. Without mentors or an understanding of the fluid nature of our energy field, we are prone to arbitrarily allowing any energy into our field and leaking vital life force energy into the ethers. <br><br><i><b>Exercise: Who Is In Your Energy Field?</b></i> <br><br>This exercise illustrates very clearly just how much you are carrying around with you at any given time. It is easy to become numb to all of the baggage and energetic clutter we accumulate over time. We acclimate to it and don't recognize how bogged down, confused, and exhausted we have become in the process. <br><br>Gather up your supplies for this exercise. You'll need to create a circle around you that is approximately 4 feet in diameter. You can use rope, a hula hoop, scarves strung together, or whatever you can come up with. The idea is to create a visual boundary or container. You will also need a pad of sticky notes or paper you can rip or cut into small pieces, and a pen. <br><br>Write down whatever comes to you for each of the categories listed below. One item per sticky. Then place each sticky inside your circle. <br>- Everyone who is in your energy field: family, friends, co-workers, etc. <br>- Decisions/issues/problems you are sitting with <br>- Health concerns <br>- Major stressors, whether on-going or one-time, like a death <br>- Things you feel responsible for <br>- Unforgiveness <br>- Shoulds <br>- Wants/desires <br>- Regrets <br>- Any other categories you can think of <br><br>Look at all of your stickies and take a moment for the impact to sink in. Look at all the names and categories. What initial reaction are you noticing in your body? <br><br>You will discover that some of these people or things in your energy field are legitimate, right, and necessary. And you'll discover that some are invasive and unnecessary. These are energies that you've let into your space whether you're conscious of it or not. Some of these people or situations give energy back to you, meaning there's a partnership or equal investment in each other. <br><br>Many of your stickies will represent people or situations that are not supporting you. They are taking from you in some way, have expectations of you, or tell you what to do. Or you take responsibility for them when responsibility isn't yours, you over-give, or are in some form of codependence. <br><br>Journal now about everything you've written down, asking yourself: <br>- What needs to change? <br>- What actions do I need to take related to all of the people and situations drawing upon my energy? <br>- What boundaries do I need to draw? <br>- What kind of self-care do I need to engage in? <br><br><b><i>Energy Leaks</i></b> <br><br>To understand the concept of energy leaks at a visceral level, close your eyes and call up in your body what it feels like when you are feeling powerful, solid, grounded, confident, energetic, and excited about your life. Look around inside yourself and at your energetic container. How do you feel? What does your container look like? How big is it? <br><br>When you are in a positive and powerful state, fully embodied, alert, and present, your energy container is solid and defined with no holes or leaks. Your container is able to fully contain you and you have clear boundaries. Your container is in integrity. <br><br>Imagine now what it feels like in your body when you feel weak, disempowered, codependent, doubting yourself, and afraid. Again, take note of whatever there is to notice. How do you feel? What does your container look like? How big is it? What is the consistency, structure, or content of your container? <br><br>Now take a deep breath to clear that visualization out of your energy field, shake out your hands, and return to a neutral state. <br><br>When you are in a disempowered or fearful state, the integrity of your energy container is obliterated. It looks like Swiss cheese, leaking energy like a sieve. Boundaries are non-existent and you probably feel exposed, weak, and vulnerable. <br><br>When your container has leaks, then it means you are either venting vital energies out into the ethers or allowing compromising energies from others or the environment into your space. Or both. Leaks show up as all kinds of unhealthy behaviors including squishy boundaries, disempowering money habits, co-dependence in relationship, taking on problems that aren&#x2019;t yours, not speaking your truth, suppressing your authentic self, feeling responsible for other people&#x2019;s emotions, and letting people take advantage of you, to name a few. <br><br>With attention and practice you can sustain a more consistently intact container and develop the skills to restore balance (plug up leaks), clear your field of unwanted or unfavorable influences, and stabilize your field after a destabilizing blow. I will cover energy leaks more in Chapter 8, which discusses boundaries in greater detail.</p><h2>Quality Management (2nd Edition)</h2><p><i>Quality Management: Creating and Sustaining Organizational Effectiveness, Second Edition</i> explores how quality management has progressed from an emphasis on the management of quality to a focus on the quality of managing, operating, and integrating customer service, marketing, production, delivery, information, and finance areas throughout an organization's value chain.

Today, we know that our brains and nervous systems change throughout our lifetimes. This concept of <i>neuroplasticity </i>has captured the imagination of a public eager for self-improvement&#x2015;and has inspired countless Internet entrepreneurs who peddle dubious &#x201c;brain training&#x201d; games and apps. In this book, Moheb Costandi offers a concise and engaging overview of neuroplasticity for the general reader, describing how our brains change continuously in response to our actions and experiences.</p><p>Costandi discusses key experimental findings, and describes how our thinking about the brain has evolved over time. He explains how the brain changes during development, and the &#x201c;synaptic pruning&#x201d; that takes place before brain maturity. He shows that adult brains can grow new cells (citing, among many other studies, research showing that sexually mature male canaries learn a new song every year). He describes the kind of brain training that can bring about improvement in brain function. It's not gadgets and games that promise to &#x201c;rewire your brain&#x201d; but such sustained cognitive tasks as learning a musical instrument or a new language. (Costandi also notes that London cabbies increase their gray matter after rigorous training in their city's complicated streets.) He tells how brains compensate after stroke or injury; describes addiction and pain as maladaptive forms of neuroplasticity; and considers brain changes that accompany childhood, adolescence, parenthood, and aging. Each of our brains is custom-built. Neuroplasticity is at the heart of what makes us human.</p></p><p>Moheb Costandi writes the Neurophilosophy blog for <i>The Guardian</i> and is the author of <i>50 Human Brain Ideas You Really Need to Know</i>.</p><h2>Slave Revolution in the Caribbean, 1789-1804: A Brief History with Documents (Bedford Series in History and Culture)</h2><p>This volume details the first slave rebellion to have a successful outcome, leading to the establishment of Haiti as a free black republic and paving the way for the emancipation of slaves in the rest of the French Empire and the world. Incited by the French Revolution, the enslaved inhabitants of the French Caribbean began a series of revolts, and in 1791 plantation workers in Haiti, then known as Saint-Domingue, overwhelmed their planter owners and began to take control of the island. They achieved emancipation in 1794, and after successfully opposing Napoleonic forces eight years later, emerged as part of an independent nation in 1804. A broad selection of documents, all newly translated by the authors, is contextualized by a thorough introduction considering the very latest scholarship. Laurent Dubois and John D.

It has become a commonplace to say that we are living in a second Gilded Age&#x2014;or, as Piketty likes to put it, a second Belle �poque&#x2014;defined by the incredible rise of the &#x2018;one percent.&#x2019; But it has only become a commonplace thanks to Piketty&#x2019;s work . . . The result has been a revolution in our understanding of long-term trends in inequality. Before this revolution, most discussion of economic disparity more or less ignored the very rich. Some economists (not to mention politicians) tried to shout down any mention of inequality at all . . . It therefore came as a revelation when Piketty and his colleagues showed that incomes of the now famous &#x2018;one percent,&#x2019; and of even narrower groups, are actually the big story in rising inequality. And this discovery came with a second revelation: talk of a second Gilded Age, which might have seemed like hyperbole, was nothing of the kind . . . Piketty has transformed our economic discourse.

Flaubert's legendary style, his intense care over the selection of words and the shaping of sentences, his unmatched ability to convey a mental world through the careful selection of telling details, shine on every page of this marvelous work. Now the award-winning translator Margaret Mauldon has produced a modern translation of this classic novel, one that perfectly captures the tone that makes Flaubert's style so distinct and admired. <br><br><em>Madame Bovary</em> scandalized its readers when it was first published in 1857. And the story itself remains as fresh today as when it was first written, a work that remains unsurpassed in its unveiling of character and society. It tells the tragic story of the romantic but empty-headed Emma Rouault. When Emma marries Charles Bovary, she imagines she will pass into the life of luxury and passion that she reads about in sentimental novels and women's magazines. But Charles is an ordinary country doctor, and provincial life is very different from the romantic excitement for which she yearns. In her quest to realize her dreams she takes a lover, Rodolphe, and begins a devastating spiral into deceit and despair. And Flaubert captures every step of this catastrophe with sharp-eyed detail and a wonderfully subtle understanding of human emotions. Malcolm Bowie, a leading authority on French literature, explores Flaubert's genius in his masterly introduction to this must-have book for all lovers of great literature.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

For OWC she has translated Zola's <em>L'Assommoir</em>, Stendhal's <em>The Charterhouse of Parma</em>, Huysmans' <em>Against Nature</em> (winner of the Scott Moncrieff Prize for translation, 1999), Constant's <em>Adolphe</em>, and Maupassant's <em>Bel-Ami</em>.

He is the author of books on Mallarm�, Freud and Proust, and his acclaimed study <em>Proust Among the Stars</em> (1998) won the $50,000 Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in 2001, the largest annual cash prize for literary criticism in the English language.<br>It still astonishes.<p> If one were to ask, "World, which is the most perfect novel ever written?," the world would immediately answer: Madame Bovary. There are novels of greater structural complexity, such as Lord Jim and The Good Soldier, or of a broader social canvas, like Anna Karenina and In Search of Lost Time, or of more stylistic dash -- Ulysses, Lolita -- and many far more beloved (Pride and Prejudice, The Great Gatsby, The Leopard), but Madame Bovary still stands as the most controlled and beautifully articulated formal masterpiece in the history of fiction.</p><p> Flaubert's artistic sensibility veered most naturally to gaudy excess, not to say a voyeuristic passion for the fleshy, sanguinary and transgressive. A little too much was hardly enough for him. In The Temptation of St. Anthony (three versions, 1849, 1856, 1874), the Queen of Sheba offers herself to the austere saint as a sexual paradise, which she sums up in the quite believable assertion, "I am not a woman, I am a world." Similarly, Salammbo (1862) -- an utterly static novel about ancient Carthage -- presents painterly tableaux of orgy, battle and torture. (I like its overripe sickly-sweetness, but am nearly alone in this taste -- it should have been illustrated by the Delacroix of "The Death of Sardanapalus.") By contrast, Flaubert's most ambitious completed novel, A Sentimental Education (1869) -- a vast social portrait of Paris in the 1840s -- errs in being too dry, too slow-moving, too programmatic. Yet its final pages -- in which the callow Frederic again meets the once-adored but now white-haired Madame Arnoux -- remain among the most honest and disillusioning in all fiction. Only in Madame Bovary (1857) -- and the story "A Simple Heart" (1877) -- did the novelist find just the right style, serene in tone, mildly ironic, tightly organized (partly through the use of unobtrusive symbolism), concise, exact and virtually without stylistic grand-standing. You can shake Madame Bovary and nothing will fall out.</p><p> Like certain other classics (The Scarlet Letter, for instance), Flaubert's tale of adultery in the provinces suffers from being a staple of the school curriculum. Generations of French-language students have parsed their way through its paragraphs, noting Emma's future ruination because of her romantic reading and brief glimpse of aristocratic life, speculating about the horse or butterfly symbolism, dissecting the stichomythia of the scene at the country fair where the announcement of agricultural prizes alternates with Rodolphe's honeyed words of seduction. Such linguistic close analysis, which Flaubert invites and rewards, may nonetheless displace attention from an equally important aspect of the novel: its narrative economy and speed. Here is one advantage to reading a translation, particularly a fine one like Margaret Mauldon's: You don't need to pause to look up all those mots justes in a dictionary. Too often students merely work their way through the text with the same grim determination that its author relied on to compose it.</p><p> In Madame Bovary Flaubert never allows anything to go on too long; he can suggest years of boredom in a paragraph, capture the essence of a character in a single conversational exchange, or show us the gulf between his soulful heroine and her dull-witted husband in a sentence (and one that, moreover, presages all Emma's later experience of men). Returning from their wedding, the newlyweds and the bridal party must cross a farmer's field:</p><p> "Emma's dress was rather long and the hem trailed a bit; from time to time she would stop and lift it up, then, with gloved fingers, delicately remove the wild grasses and tiny thistle burrs, while Charles stood empty-handed, waiting for her to finish."</p><p>As in Jane Austen, there's pervasive irony throughout Flaubert, some of it verging on the heavy-handed: Charles, unaware as usual, announces to the lecherous Rodolphe "that his wife was at his disposal." But what struck me most in rereading the book this time are its tiny, almost casual, naturalistic details:</p><p> Describing the houses in Yonville, we learn that "here and there the plastered walls, crossed diagonally by black beams, support a straggly pear tree, and at the doors of the houses are miniature swinging gates, to keep out the baby chicks that cluster round the step to peck at crumbs of brown bread soaked in cider."</p><p> Leon, a young lawyer who has begun to fall in love with Emma, accompanies the young mother on a visit to the wet-nurse: "Madame Bovary blushed, and he turned away, fearful lest his glance might perhaps have been too bold. The baby had just vomited on the collar of her dress, and she put her down again in the cradle. The wet-nurse quickly came over to wipe up the mess, assuring Emma that it wouldn't show."</p><p> At the agricultural fair, "to one side, about a hundred yards beyond the enclosure, motionless as a statue of bronze, stood a great black bull wearing a muzzle, with an iron ring in its nostril. A child dressed in rags held it by a rope."</p><p> Finally, what could be more true to life than this? Leon is trying to seduce Emma inside the Rouen Cathedral, but "she seemed determined to let him talk without interrupting him. She sat with her arms crossed, looking down at the rosettes on her slippers, occasionally wriggling her toes slightly inside the satin."</p><p> Though Madame Bovary escapes Flaubert's predilection for overblown, histrionic description, his heroine is primarily a woman of gestures, a mime of the grandly operatic emotions she yearns to feel. In her love-talk Emma can be as saccharine as a P.G. Wodehouse female lyricizing over the stars as "God's daisy chain." Because she comes to fear any diminution in passion, Emma inevitably takes to growing more brazen, more desperately fantastic, with each sexual encounter. Fundamentally, she is an empty vessel, a pretty B-movie actress trying out new roles which she then overplays.</p><p>And yet it's hard not to sympathize with this doomed young woman. Flaubert may have wanted us to regard her as essentially kitsch, a creature formed by impossible reveries of blissful self-fulfillment, whether in marriage, passion or religious observance. But Emma nonetheless tries, and tries hard, to live her dreams and in this sense is hardly different from, say, Fitzgerald's Gatsby. Or any of the rest of us. Don't we all ache with unabashed hopes, unassuaged desires? For Emma, the ball at La Vaubyessard shines as a golden interlude in her drab life, a glimpse of paradise. Nonetheless, "little by little, in her memory, the faces all blurred together; she forgot the tunes of the quadrilles; no longer could she so clearly picture the liveries and the rooms; some details disappeared, but the yearning remained." The yearning always remains.</p><p> For the modern reader, familiar with adultery through magazine articles, television soap operas or personal experience, Madame Bovary shows how surprisingly common, how standardized, is the blueprint for such illicit affairs: The soft-focused imaginings, the touch of a hand, a suggestive phrase or smile, the search for seclusion, the breathless rush to the lover's arms, the fear of exposure, the financial outlay (and the need to hide it), the ever-growing recklessness, and then, more and more often, the violent arguments and impossible demands, the violation of promises, mutual recrimination and, finally, inevitably, the tearful break-up, leading to further heartache or embitterment and, sometimes, relief. As Flaubert writes about the last days of the affair with Leon, "They knew one another too well to experience that wonderment of mutual possession that increases its joy a hundredfold. She was as sick of him as he was weary of her. Emma was discovering, in adultery, all the banality of marriage."</p><p> When Emma tells her first lover, Rodolphe -- cad, bounder, scoundrel, rake -- how much she adores him, how she will be his servant, submit to his every desire as his concubine, Flaubert observes:</p><p> "He had heard these things said to him so many times that they no longer held any surprises for him. Emma was just like all his mistresses, and the charm of novelty, gradually falling away like a garment, laid bare the eternal monotony of passion, which never varies in its forms and its expression."</p><p> Such world-weary, Gallic cynicism. But Emma truly loves Rodolphe (or thinks she does). Still "he could not see -- this man of such broad experience -- the difference of feeling, beneath the similarity of expression. Because wanton or venal lips had murmured the same words to him, he only half believed in the sincerity of those he was hearing now; to a large extent they should be disregarded, he believed, because such exaggerated language must surely mask commonplace feelings: as if the soul in its fullness did not sometimes overflow into the most barren metaphors, since no one can ever tell the precise measure of his own needs, of his own ideas, of his own pain . . ." That is movingly true in itself -- how often do words fail us when we wish to express our deepest feelings -- but Flaubert, in his genius, caps even this with one of his most imaginative and disheartening similes:</p><p> " . . . and human language is like a cracked kettledrum on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, when what we long to do is make music that will move the stars to pity."</p><p> In his excellent introduction to this new edition, Malcolm Bowie further analyzes this passage to demonstrate how Flaubert is actively arguing with his own characters, thus enhancing the narrative dynamic of the novel. That's certainly true, but ordinary readers can think about it later. What truly matters is this: Madame Bovary is available in a superb new translation, in a handsome hardback volume, and if you've never read it, or if you've only worked through it in first-year college French, you need to sit down with this book as soon as possible. This is one of the summits of prose art, and not to know such a masterpiece is to live a diminished life. Some early critics complained that Emma's story was a sordid and commonplace one, yet that is, paradoxically, its glory. The novelist once famously proclaimed that he himself was Madame Bovary -- but failed to add that so are you, so am I. We are all the victims of unrealized or unrealizable dreams. They somehow slip from our grasp or glitter before our eyes, only a little beyond our reach. "I admire tinsel as much as gold," Flaubert once wrote in a letter. "Indeed, the poetry of tinsel is even greater, because it is sadder."</p><p>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

M. Forster&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&#x2019;s third novel has long been the most popular of his early works. A young girl, Lucy Honeychurch, and her chaperon&#x2015;products of proper Edwardian England&#x2015;visit a tempestuous, passionate Italy. Their &#x201c;room with a view&#x201d; allows them to look into a world far different from their own, a world unconcerned with convention, unfettered by social rituals, and unafraid of emotion. Soon Lucy finds herself bound to an obviously &#x201c;unsuitable&#x201d; man, the melancholic George Emerson, whose improper advances she dare not publicize. Back home, her friend and mentor Charlotte Bartlett and her mother, try to manipulate her into marriage with the more &#x201c;appropriate&#x201d; but smotheringly dull Cecil Vyse, whose surname suggests the imprisoning effect he would have on Lucy&#x2019;s spirit.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;RA colorful gallery of characters, including George&#x2019;s riotously funny father, Lucy&#x2019;s sullen brother, the novelist Eleanor Lavish, and the reverend Mr. Beebe, line up on either side, and &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RA Room with a View&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R unfolds as a delightfully satiric comedy of manners and an immensely satisfying love story. &amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RRadhika Jones&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R is a freelance writer and a Ph.D. candidate in English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/DIV&amp;&amp;R</p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesA Room With a View portrays the love of a British woman for an expatriate living in Italy, a country which to Forster represents the forces of true passion. Caught up in a world of social snobbery, Forster's heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, finds herself constrained by the claustrophobic influence of her British guardians, who encourage her to take up with a well-connected boor. When she regrets that her hotel room has no view, a member of the lower class offers to trade rooms with her. Lucy becomes caught in a struggle between her own emotions and social conventions. In the end, however, Lucy takes control of her own fate and finds love with a man whose free spirit reminds her of a "room with a view".<p>There are some writers whose work is especially suitable for out-loud reading and E.M. Forster is one. His voices enter the ear with such a delicate balance of force and refinement that listeners are immediately enchanted.</p></p><h2>The Mind and Heart of the Negotiator</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Based on the latest research findings, this book provides an integrated, big-picture view of what to <i>do</i> and what to <i>avoid</i> at the bargaining table, It combines a strong applied flavor with straightforward and lively writing, presents a unified, comprehensive overview of the insights, strategies, and practices inherent in successful negotiations, and addresses the most common myths and pitfalls that plague negotiators. <b> </b> Over 100 case study examples of negotiations from the business world are used to analyze and demonstrate points.

Urban form is the focus: the physical appearance and overall plans of the cities, their architecture and natural topography, and the cultural and historical contexts in which they flourished. Attention is also paid to non-urban features such as religious sanctuaries and burial grounds, places and institutions that were a familiar part of the city dweller's experience. Objects or artifacts that represented the essential furnishings of everyday life are discussed, such as pottery, sculpture, wall paintings, mosaics and coins. <em>Ancient Cities</em> is unusual in presenting this wide range of Old World cultures in such comprehensive detail, giving equal weight to the Preclassical and Classical periods, and in showing the links between these ancient cultures.</p> <p></p> <p>User-friendly features include:</p> <ul> <ul> <p> </p><li>use of clear and accessible language, assuming no previous background knowledge </li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>lavishly illustrated with over 300 line drawings, maps, and photos </li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>historical summaries, further reading arranged by topic, plus a consolidated bibliography and comprehensive index </li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>new to the second edition: a companion website with an interactive timeline, chapter summaries, study questions, illustrations and a glossary of archaeological and historical terms.</li> <p></p></ul></ul> <p>Visit the website at http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415498647/</p> <p>In this second edition, Charles Gates has comprehensively revised and updated his original text, and Neslihan Y&#x131;lmaz has reworked her acclaimed illustrations. Readers and lecturers will be delighted to see a new chapter on Phoenician cities in the first millennium BC, and new sections on G�bekli Tepe, the sensational Neolithic sanctuary; Sinope, a Greek city on the Black Sea coast; and cities of the western Roman Empire. With its comprehensive presentation of ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern cities, its rich collection of illustrations, and its new companion website, <em>Ancient Cities</em> will remain an essential textbook for university and high school students across a wide range of archaeology, ancient history, and ancient Near Eastern, Biblical, and classical studies courses.</p></p><p><p>Charles Gates is senior lecturer of archaeology and art history at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.

Can we hold democracy together despite fractures over moral issues? Are there moral limits on the struggle against terror? Asking how the citizens of modern democracy can reason with one another, this book carves out a controversial position between those who view religious voices as an anathema to democracy and those who believe democratic society is a moral wasteland because such voices are not heard.</p><br><p> Drawing inspiration from Whitman, Dewey, and Ellison, Jeffrey Stout sketches the proper role of religious discourse in a democracy. He discusses the fate of virtue, the legacy of racism, the moral issues implicated in the war on terrorism, and the objectivity of ethical norms. Against those who see no place for religious reasoning in the democratic arena, Stout champions a space for religious voices. But against increasingly vocal antiliberal thinkers, he argues that modern democracy can provide a moral vision and has made possible such moral achievements as civil rights precisely because it allows a multitude of claims to be heard.</p><br><p> Stout's distinctive pragmatism reconfigures the disputed area where religious thought, political theory, and philosophy meet. Charting a path beyond the current impasse between secular liberalism and the new traditionalism, <i>Democracy and Tradition</i> asks whether we have the moral strength to continue as a democratic people as it invigorates us to retrieve our democratic virtues from very real threats to their practice.</p></p><p><p>"With a clarity that can only be gained through a charitable reading of those with whom he disagrees, Stout inaugurates a fresh conversation between advocates of democracy and those who hold substantive Christian convictions. In <i>Democracy and Tradition</i>, the Emersonian tradition is given new life, helping Americans envision what a vital politics contains."<b>--Stanley Hauerwas, Duke Divinity School</b></p><p>"This is the most important work in political philosophy since Rawls published <i>A Theory of Justice</i>. Stout's account of the formation of democratic culture in America demonstrates that rights theory and virtue theory can and do cohere in a complex and rich tradition. With both eyes open, Stout displays both the serious challenges facing democracy in America (including the new religious traditionalists) and the resources for strengthening it (including feminist and African-American religious critics, as well as the American pragmatist tradition). This book should be taught alongside Rawls in law schools and Hauerwas in seminaries. It is also a substantial contribution to American studies, cultural studies, political theory, American history, and philosophical and religious ethics."<b>--Charles Reynolds, University of Tennessee</b></p><p>"Jeffrey Stout has recast the debate about morality and tradition in our constitutional democracy. No more demonization, no more Manichean battles between 'militant secularists' and 'religious traditionalists.' Brilliantly original, historically sensitive, and analytically rigorous, Stout's writings are suffused with respect for the intelligence and goodwill of his fellow citizens, believers and nonbelievers alike."<b>--M. Cathleen Kaveny, John P. Murphy Foundation Professor of Law and Professor of Theology, University of Notre Dame</b></p><p>"Stout has done more than any other writer to bring to our attention the problems facing democracy due to our inability to talk things over with religious believers. His book is an original, engaging, and very important contribution to the discussion of these problems. People in a wide variety of fields will need to pay attention to it."<b>--J. B. Schneewind, The Johns Hopkins University</b></p><p>"Stout rejects the claim that liberal democracy is a moral wasteland, with no substantive idea of the good and only minimal resources for maintaining a shaky social order. He shows that democracy's moral achievements have been brought about by the uniquely democratic commitment to allowing all members of the community an equal voice in demanding reasons for action and policy touching the whole. <i>Democracy and Tradition</i> will give rise to a new set of questions about the place of religion in American politics and the way in which political philosophy is written."<b>--G. Scott Davis, University of Richmond</b></p><b>Jeffrey Stout</b> is Professor of Religion at Princeton University. He is the author of <i>Ethics after Babel</i> (Princeton) as well as essays and reviews in such journals as <i>The Monist, New Literary History</i>, and <i>The Journal of Religion</i>. He is a contributing editor of the <i>Journal of Religious</i> Ethics.</p><h2>Arias in Silence</h2><p>This book encompasses the breadth of Gordon Parks&#39;s compelling new photographic work.

What he observed formed the basis for this expose of autocratic practices which meted out to white men on board the same treatment as black slaves received on plantations. Published in 1850, WHITE JACKET reflected deep-rooted tensions that led to the Civil War 15 years later.</p><p>lle&#x2019;s most popular novels during his lifetime&#x2015;and the subject of renewed interest in recent decades&#x2015;<i>White-Jacket</i> is both a brisk sea adventure and a powerful social critique. Based on Melville&#x2019;s own experiences, it explores the fascinating and often harrowing world of a naval fighting ship, the <i>Neversink</i>. The ship becomes for Melville a microcosm of America itself; its hierarchy, social divisions, and cruel practices suggest larger injustices, including slavery. <br><br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic reproduces the definitive Northwestern-Newberry Edition.The aim of this edition of &#39;White-Jacket, &#39; the fifth volume in the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of &#39;The Writings of Herman Melville, &#39; is to present a text as close to the author&#39;s intention as surviving evidence permits.</p><h2>Can You Be Gay and Christian?: Responding With Love and Truth to Questions About Homosexuality</h2><p><b>The question of how the church deals with homosexuality has become the great moral and spiritual issue of this generation. </b><br> How do we respond to gay people who tell us how much they love the Lord and experience God&#x2019;s power? How do we answer them when they say that the greatest law is the law of love, and that love requires us to embrace them as they are? What do we do with the argument that the Old Testament laws (such as the prohibition against homosexuality and the dietary laws) no longer apply?<br> <br> <i>Gay and Christian?</i> will provide solid biblical answers, clearly written and based on sound scholarship, in a compassionate way that causes the reader to wrestle with the issues and discover the biblical truth. The book also provides practical guidelines for ministry and shows readers how they can resist the gay agenda while reaching out to their gay friends and family.</p><p><b>Michael L.

They told tales of vice and intrigue that purported to be "based on fact" and also advocated the need for better female education that would prepare young women against sweet-talking seducers. Extremely popular in America after the Revolution and throughout the nineteenth century, <em>Charlotte Temple</em> and <em>The Coquette</em> were two of the most successful novels of the period. Reprinted here in their entirety, with Introductions by the literary scholar Cathy N. Davidson, they offer the modern student a glimpse at the earliest American popular fiction.<br> <em>Charlotte Temple</em>, the most popular novel in America until Harriet Beecher Stowe's <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>, went through over 200 editions. It tells of a beautiful English girl who at the age of 15 is courted by and runs away with a British lieutenant named Montraville.<br> Susanna Rowson, the daughter of a British naval officer, was one of the most accomplished women of the early national period. Actress, song-writer, novelist, poet, dramatist, and essayist, she was also the founder of one of the most progressive academies for young women of her day. She remained best-known, however, for <em>Charlotte Temple</em>, a novel that promised to be "of service to [the]...young and unprotected woman in her first entrance into life."<br> In her Introduction, Cathy Davidson discusses the enormous popularity of the book and the life of Susanna Rowson, which was even more sensational than those of the characters depicted in the novel.<br></p><p>With an Introduction by Jane Smiley <br>First published in America in 1794, Charlotte Temple took the country by storm--in fact, it was this nation's first bona fide "bestseller." Susanna Rowson's most famous work is the story of an innocent British schoolgirl who takes the advice of her depraved French teacher-- with tragic consequences. Seduced by the dashing Lieutenant Montraville, who persuades her to move to America with him, the fifteen-year-old Charlotte leaves her adoring parents and makes the treacherous sea voyage to New York. In the land of opportunity, Charlotte is callously abandoned by Montraville. Alone and pregnant with an illegitimate child, she valiantly fights to stave off poverty and ruin. <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the text of the first American edition.Cathy N.

Huggins Lectures)</h2><p><p>Perhaps no event in American history arouses more impassioned debate than the abolition of slavery. Answers to basic questions about who ended slavery, how, and why remain fiercely contested more than a century and a half after the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. In <i>The Long Emancipation</i>, Ira Berlin draws upon decades of study to offer a framework for understanding slavery&#x2019;s demise in the United States. Freedom was not achieved in a moment, and emancipation was not an occasion but a near-century-long process&#x2015;a shifting but persistent struggle that involved thousands of men and women.</p><p>Berlin teases out the distinct characteristics of emancipation, weaving them into a larger narrative of the meaning of American freedom. The most important factor was the will to survive and the enduring resistance of enslaved black people themselves. In striving for emancipation, they were also the first to raise the crucial question of their future status. If they were no longer slaves, what would they be? African Americans provided the answer, drawing on ideals articulated in the Declaration of Independence and precepts of evangelical Christianity. Freedom was their inalienable right in a post-slavery society, for nothing seemed more natural to people of color than the idea that all Americans should be equal.</p><p>African Americans were not naive about the price of their idealism. Just as slavery was an institution initiated and maintained by violence, undoing slavery also required violence. Freedom could be achieved only through generations of long and brutal struggle.</p></p><p>Ira Berlin was Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park.&#x201c;Ira Berlin ranks as one of the greatest living historians of slavery in the United States... <i>The Long Emancipation</i> offers a useful reminder that abolition was not the charitable work of respectable white people, or not mainly that. Instead, the demise of slavery was made possible by the constant discomfort inflicted on middle-class white society by black activists. And like the participants in today&#x2019;s Black Lives Matter movement, Berlin has not forgotten that the history of slavery in the United States&#x2015;especially the history of how slavery ended&#x2015;is never far away when contemporary Americans debate whether their nation needs to change.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Edward E. Baptist</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The cause of the end of slavery in the U.S. is a long, complex story that is usually, in the general reading public&#x2019;s mind, simplified by &#x2018;the Civil War ended it.&#x2019; In this remarkably cogent, impressively thought-out, and even beautifully styled account by a university historian, we are given emphatic witness to his long-held professional conviction that &#x2018;freedom&#x2019;s arrival,&#x2019; as he phrases it, was not due to a &#x2018;moment or a man&#x2019; but because of a process that took a century to unfold.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Brad Hooper</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A short, fast-paced interpretive history of the transition of African Americans from chattels to free persons. [Berlin] challenges previous scholars who identify both a &#x2018;moment&#x2019; and a human factor that sparked emancipation&#x2015;generally either President Abraham Lincoln or the South&#x2019;s slaves&#x2015;for initiating slavery&#x2019;s overthrow. Instead, Berlin takes the long view in charting emancipation&#x2019;s circuitous metamorphosis, from the late 18th century until the 1860s... In the end, Berlin credits black persons, north and south, for gradually but forcefully removing slavery&#x2019;s stain from the fabric of American life.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J. D. Smith</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Berlin lucidly illuminates the &#x2018;near-century-long&#x2019; process of abolition and how, in many ways, the work of emancipation continues today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><h2>Viajes: Introduccion al espanol (World Languages)</h2><p>VIAJES: INTRODUCCI�N AL ESPA�OL, Second Edition, is a perfect fit for introductory Spanish courses in which instructors want comprehensive coverage in one academic year without compromising the authenticity of the interactions and the quality of the content.</p><p>Dr. Robert Hershberger (Ph.D., University of Kansas) is Associate Professor of Spanish at DePauw University.

You dream of a baby who will be strong, healthy, and bright&#x2014;and you make plans to ensure her success. You probably also have fears and questions, especially if this is your first child, or if there have been problems with this or a previous pregnancy. What if something goes wrong during the pregnancy? What if labor and delivery are difficult? What if your expectations of being a parent aren&#x2019;t met? These are perfectly normal feelings and fears. The nine months of pregnancy will give time to answer questions, calm fears, and prepare for the realities of parenthood.<br><br>Some of your initial concerns may already have been addressed if you had difficulty becoming pregnant, particularly if you sought fertility treatment. But now that you&#x2019;re pregnant, preparations for your new baby can begin. The best way to help your baby is to take care of yourself. Regular medical and dental attention and good nutrition directly benefits both you and your baby&#x2019;s health. Plenty of rest and moderate exercise will help ease the physical stresses of pregnancy. Talk to your physician about your health and your baby&#x2019;s health, including prenatal vitamins, and avoid smoking, alcohol, using drugs (including marijuana), and eating fish containing high levels of mercury. If you are taking any medications, check with your obstetrician about their safety during pregnancy.<br><br>As pregnancy progresses, you&#x2019;re confronted with a long list of decisions, from planning for the delivery to decorating the nursery. Many decisions may already have happened, but others may have been postponed because your baby doesn&#x2019;t seem &#x201c;real&#x201d; yet. However, the more actively you prepare for your baby&#x2019;s arrival, the more real that child will seem.<br><br>You may find yourself constantly thinking about this baby-to-be. This preoccupation is perfectly normal and actually may help prepare you emotionally for the challenge of parenthood. After all, you&#x2019;ll be making decisions about your child for the next two decades&#x2014;at least! Now is a perfect time to start.<br><br>Giving Your Baby a Healthy Start<br><br>Virtually everything you consume or inhale while pregnant will be passed through to the fetus. This process begins as soon as you conceive. In fact, the embryo is most vulnerable during the first two months, when the major body parts (arms, legs, hands, feet, liver, heart, genitalia, eyes, and brain) are just starting to form. The chemical substances in cigarettes, alcohol, illegal drugs, and certain medications can interfere with the developmental process, and some can even cause congenital abnormalities. For instance, if you smoke cigarettes during pregnancy, your baby&#x2019;s birth weight may be decreased. Even breathing in smoke from the cigarettes of others (passive smoking) can affect your baby. Stay away from smoking areas and ask smokers not to light up around you. If you&#x2019;re a smoker, this is the time to stop&#x2014;not just until you give birth, but forever. Children who grow up in a home where someone smokes have a greater risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), more ear infections and more respiratory problems during infancy and early childhood, and even an increased risk of childhood obesity. They also have been shown to be more likely to smoke when they grow up.<br><br>WHERE WE STAND<br><br>The American Academy of Pediatrics&#x2019; message is clear&#x2014;don&#x2019;t smoke when pregnant; protect yourself and your children from secondhand tobacco smoke. Many studies have shown that if a woman smokes or is exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy, her child may be born too early (prematurely) or be smaller than normal. Other effects of smoking during pregnancy may include sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), depressed breathing movements while in the uterus, learning problems, respiratory disorders, and heart disease as an adult.<br><br>After birth, children exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke have more respiratory infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, poor lung function, and asthma than children who aren&#x2019;t exposed. Smoke exposure is most dangerous for younger children because they have immature lungs and spend more time with parents or other smokers.<br><br>If you smoke, quit. Ask your child&#x2019;s pediatrician or your primary care doctor for free help, or call 1-800-QUIT-NOW. If you can&#x2019;t quit, don&#x2019;t expose your child to smoke&#x2014;make your home and car completely smoke-free. The Academy supports legislation that would prohibit smoking in public places, including outdoor public places that children frequent.<br><br>Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is also a concern and increases the risk for a condition called fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is responsible for birth defects, low birth weight, and below-average intelligence. Fetal alcohol syndrome is also the leading cause of intellectual disability in newborns. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy also increases the likelihood of a miscarriage or preterm delivery. There is evidence that the more alcohol consumed, the greater the risk to the fetus. It is safest not to drink any alcoholic beverages during pregnancy.<br><br>WHERE WE STAND<br><br>Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, intellectual disability, and other developmental disorders in newborns. There is no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. For that reason, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that women who are pregnant, or who are planning to become pregnant, abstain from drinking alcoholic beverages of any kind.<br><br>Chemicals from marijuana, either smoked or from edibles, can be passed to your developing baby during pregnancy. Studies are limited, but the data suggest that use of marijuana may interfere with the baby&#x2019;s brain development, cause intellectual disabilities, or cause behavioral problems later in life. Marijuana smoke also poses risks similar to tobacco smoke.<br><br>No illicit drug is safe to use during pregnancy. Stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine can cause elevated maternal blood pressure, low birth weight, and premature delivery. Opioids like OxyContin and heroin cause withdrawal symptoms in newborns that can keep them hospitalized for weeks or more. If you become pregnant while using drugs, inform your obstetrician so that she can help you find safe, appropriate care.<br><br>WHERE WE STAND<br><br>Marijuana use has been legalized in a number of states, which may lead some women to believe that the drug is safe or even beneficial in pregnancy. Research on the effects of marijuana exposure in the womb or through breast milk is limited, but what we do know suggests that marijuana use by mothers may be dangerous to the baby&#x2019;s developing brain. Women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing should avoid marijuana use. If you are using marijuana to treat nausea, talk to your doctor about safer alternatives.<br><br>When preparing for your baby, you may decide to paint and add new furniture to the nursery. It&#x2019;s important to have good ventilation in spaces you&#x2019;re painting, to avoid inhaling large amounts of fumes. New furniture can harbor chemicals and should be allowed to ventilate before placing your baby in or near it. Exposures do not only happen in the home; workplaces may have chemicals in use that, when inhaled, can result in harm to you and your baby. Your employer should provide you with personal protective equipment or other assignments if you are exposed to chemicals or dust in the workplace.<br><br>You should avoid all medications and supplements except those your physician has specifically recommended. This includes not only prescription drugs you&#x2019;re already taking, but also nonprescription or over-the-counter products such as aspirin, cold medications, and antihistamines. Even vitamins can be dangerous if taken in high doses. (For example, excessive amounts of vitamin A have been known to cause congenital abnormalities.) Consult with your physician before taking drugs or supplements of any kind during pregnancy, even those labeled &#x201c;natural.&#x201d;<br><br>Fish and shellfish contain high-quality protein and other essential nutrients, are low in saturated fat, and contain omega-3 fatty acids. They can be an essential part of a balanced diet for pregnant women.<br><br>However, you should be aware of the possible health risks from eating fish while pregnant. Avoid raw fish, as it may contain parasites such as flukes or worms. Cooking and freezing are the most effective ways to kill the parasites. For safety reasons, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends cooking fish to an internal temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). Certain types of cooked sushi such as eel and California rolls are safe to eat when pregnant.<br><br>The most worrisome contaminant in fish is mercury (or more specifically, methylmercury). Mercury has been shown to be damaging to the fetus&#x2019;s brain and nervous system development. The FDA advises pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children to avoid eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (from the Gulf of Mexico) due to high levels of mercury in these fish. According to the FDA, pregnant women can safely eat an average of 8&#x2013;12 ounces (two to three average servings) of a variety of other types of cooked fish each week. Five commonly eaten fish low in mercury are shrimp, canned or packaged light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish. Albacore tuna can be high in mercury, so canned chunk light tuna is a better choice. If there are no local health advisories about fish caught in your area, you can eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) per week of local fish, but don&#x2019;t consume any other fish during that week.</p><h2>Building a Foundation in Mathematics</h2><p>Real-world, on-the-job scenarios and a clear, straightforward approach bring to life the fundamental mathematical concepts that readers will learn with BUILDING A FOUNDATION IN MATHEMATICS, 2nd EDITION.

It&#x2019;s about you&#x2014;and it can be summed up succinctly but completely with a single word. <br>Commit. <br>That&#x2019;s it. &#x201c;To carry into action deliberately.&#x201d; Commit. <br>Show up for your first day of law school with only a vague notion of why you&#x2019;re there&#x2014;without a clear set of reasons for putting yourself through the punishment you&#x2019;re about to endure&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll be setting yourself up for a miserable and unfulfilling three years. Show up committed, with a well thought-out set of goals supported by reasons for attaining them, and the experience can be exhilarating. <br>The choice is yours. You picked up this book looking for answers, or maybe a &#x201c;quick fix&#x201d; that will put you ahead of your competitors in the rough-and-tumble world of law school. You have it in one word: commit. That&#x2019;s it. Don&#x2019;t &#x201c;decide&#x201d; to go to law school. Don&#x2019;t &#x201c;try&#x201d; law school. Commit to law school. That is the pure axiom of law school success. Commit, or forget it&#x2014;for in law school, to quote the ancient Jedi master Yoda, &#x201c;there is no try.&#x201d; <br>Still with me? <br>Now&nbsp;&#x2026; about the cocky guy next to you who just put this book back on the shelf with a &#x201c;Hrumph&#x201d; after reading these first few paragraphs&#x2014;don&#x2019;t worry about him. That&#x2019;s the overconfident guy who will spend the first weeks of law school casually reading cases, partying in the bars, and teasing you about studying too much. Learn to love that guy because he&#x2019;s someone you&#x2019;re going to flog on your first-semester finals. Trust me on that because I used to know that guy. <br>He was me. <br>Step number one on the road to your commitment to law school is to ask yourself one critical question. Why do you want to go to law school? <br>No really. Think about it. What&#x2019;s driving you? Force yourself to come up with an answer. Now be honest. Does your answer, or something like it, appear on this list? <br>&#x2022; because my mom/dad/sibling/relative/friend is a lawyer <br>&#x2022; because I took the LSAT and got a good score <br>&#x2022; because I&#x2019;m not good at science and wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get into med school <br>&#x2022; because lawyers make good salaries and have financial and/or job security <br>&#x2022; because most of the people at my school are applying to law/med school <br>&#x2022; because I watch&nbsp; <i>Law &amp; Order</i>&nbsp;reruns and think they&#x2019;re interesting <br>&#x2022; because I&#x2019;ve read all of John Grisham&#x2019;s novels and find them fascinating <br>&#x2022; because I don&#x2019;t know what else to do and law is a respectable profession <br>&#x2022; because my parents/relatives/teachers/friends think I&#x2019;m a &#x201c;born lawyer&#x201d; <br>Okay. So if your rationale for going to law school appears above, all is not lost. It just means that you need to rethink your motivations because these just aren&#x2019;t going to cut it for you. Let&#x2019;s dispel some illusions. <br>My relative the lawyer made me do it <br>First of all, what is it about your parent/sibling/friend the lawyer that makes you want to follow him into his profession? Is it the money? The prestige? Do you even know whether this person is happy practicing law? Have you asked him lately? More important, have you ever followed this person through a typical day&#x2014;or even better, a typical week? Ever ask this person what he likes least about the law, or about how much time he spends in court compared to how much time he spends with his nose buried in the books? Ever ask how long it took him to make partner, or how many hours a week he had to work to become partner? Ever ask him how much time he gets to spend with his kids, on his hobbies, or exercising? How her relationships are with her family and friends? These are revealing questions that may help you explore a career in law more realistically. Ask them before you romanticize your relative the lawyer. <br>I can&#x2019;t ignore this amazing LSAT score, can I? <br>Why not? The LSAT is allegedly an aptitude test that predicts how well you&#x2019;ll do in law school, but the accuracy of this correlation is controversial and much debated. A good LSAT score is a tremendous asset when applying to law schools. A whole chapter in this book is devoted to teaching you how to get the best possible score. However, the test bears almost no resemblance to what you&#x2019;ll be doing in law school, and even less to the actual practice of law. Both law school and law practice require well-developed research and writing skills, and to a lesser extent, oral advocacy proficiency, none of which is tested on the LSAT. No legal concepts are tested on the LSAT, which is basically a souped-up, trickier SAT. Yet some would use a good LSAT score to justify law as a career choice. A good LSAT score may bring you to the dance, but it&#x2019;s no guarantee that you&#x2019;ll be happy to be there. <br>I don&#x2019;t have a mind for science, so&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>Otherwise known as the old &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be a doctor because I couldn&#x2019;t hack orgo, so I might as well be a lawyer&#x201d; rationale. Trust me, I get it&nbsp;&#x2026; I took orgo twice myself, but seriously, where&#x2019;s the logic in that argument? We&#x2019;re not playing the game of Life here&#x2014;this is the real thing. Contrary to the beliefs of many, there are other career choices besides law, medicine, and investment banking. Maybe you should explore some of them. Take a year off to travel, learn a language, teach, write, or work for a nonprofit or volunteer organization. Start your own business. Think a little and figure out what it is that you like to do. Don&#x2019;t just fall into this ridiculous mind trap and go straight for the law school applications because all your friends are doing it. To quote your mom, &#x201c;If all your friends jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>It&#x2019;s the economy, stupid <br>This is one of the biggest misconceptions of all. If you&#x2019;re going into law because you think it&#x2019;s your road to riches, stop and go directly to business school or ignore the advice in the last section and become an I-banker. That&#x2019;s where the real money is. While associates in big-city law firms&nbsp; <i>do</i>&nbsp;make six-figure salaries right out of law school, in a good year I-bankers at comparably large investment firms commonly make that much in their holiday bonus. Similarly, a successful business idea can bring you a partner-level salary two or three years after start-up, not to mention stock options, a flexible work schedule, and the pleasure of being your own boss. <br>Remember this&#x2014;the average lawyer&#x2019;s salary in the United States is still only about $40,000 per year. Sure, partners at big-city firms may pull down over a million a year&nbsp;&#x2026; but those big salaries generally belong only to the real rainmakers, and it may have taken even them fifteen to twenty years of eighty-hour weeks, two failed marriages, and a heart attack to get there. Clients don&#x2019;t just grow on trees or fall out of the sky. You have to earn the right to represent clients, and that takes serious time and effort. Meanwhile, the prosecutors you&#x2019;ve romanticized from television or the novels you&#x2019;ve read may make as little as $25,000 a year while working the same hours. So don&#x2019;t kid yourself. A career in law does provide some job security and a good assurance that you and your family won&#x2019;t starve on the streets, but if money is your primary motivator, there are much easier ways to make your millions. <br>This ain&#x2019;t Hollywood, son <br>That brings us to the unspoken reason why many people go to law school&#x2014;the secret longing to be Tom Cruise in&nbsp; <i>The Firm</i>, Gregory Peck in&nbsp; <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, Sam Waterston in&nbsp; <i>Law &amp; Order</i>. Unfortunately, this too is a romanticized notion of the law. Most lawyers never make guest appearances on CNN or get to parade secret, star witnesses into court to the gasps of the gallery. The vast majority of cases settle before trial, and the work between intake and settlement is a long, private grind of discovery battles, document review, motion practice, and many hours spent reading, writing, and thinking far from the limelight. If your aspirations about law school center on supercharged days before a jury and invitations to appear on national television after your latest victory, it&#x2019;s time to wake up to the reality of what the practice of law is really like. <br>Most lawyers, even the really good ones, typically toil in the state and lower federal courts, often on mundane legal issues. Most lawyers will never argue before the U.S. Supreme Court, and an appearance before a circuit court of appeals or a chance to break new legal ground may only occur once or twice in a career. That&#x2019;s not to say that your days as a lawyer won&#x2019;t be interesting or intellectually challenging. Many of them will be. But they won&#x2019;t be like what you see in the movies. <br>Finally, remember that even what you see on&nbsp; <i>Law &amp; Order</i>&nbsp;is the culmination of hundreds of hours of hard work in the library reading cases, developing theories, drafting court briefs and memoranda, and taking depositions from unwilling witnesses in law firm conference rooms&#x2014;things the producers will never show you on television. For every hour of court time you log, you may spend hundreds of hours reading, researching, and writing. If you become a civil or criminal litigator or a prosecutor, you&#x2019;ll have your days in court before a judge and jury&#x2014;but if you go to work for a big-city firm, it may take you five to ten years to even see the inside of a courtroom, and even longer to try your own cases. In the meantime, you&#x2019;ll be a researcher&#x2014;analyzing issues, finding applicable cases, and writing memoranda to the more senior associates and partners in the firm. You&#x2019;ll typically be asked to work sixty-to-eighty-hour weeks, late nights, and at least some weekends. <br>Your fate is typically better in a smaller firm, or working for a state or federal prosecutor. Doing so can bring these opportunities much more rapidly&#x2014;often within the first year or two, but these positions typically pay much less. <br>On the corporate side, it is much the same story. If you want to become a dealmaker in a large city, you&#x2019;ll need to get in line. For the first few years, you&#x2019;ll be paid handsomely to draft boilerplate agreements and spend late nights at the printer arguing over the placement of commas in merger agreements and initial public offerings. Remember that at a big firm, there may be sixty to eighty starry-eyed associates in your &#x201c;class,&#x201d; all of whom want the same plum assignments that you do. Someone has to do the scut work, though, and for the first few years, that will be you. While smaller firms again offer more rapid opportunity, the deals are also smaller. Further, someone still has to proofread these agreements&#x2014;and that someone is still going to be you. Oh&#x2014;and if you&#x2019;re thinking of going the in-house route, remember that most corporations won&#x2019;t even consider hiring someone right out of law school. You&#x2019;ll need some years of firm experience first, unless you hook up with your friend&#x2019;s start-up company, and if you do, remember that 95 percent of these &#x201c;start-up&#x201d; companies never actually get anywhere. <br>Of course, there are exceptions to all these scenarios. Partners in big firms will occasionally take promising young associates under their wings, channel them interesting and important work, or provide them with uncommon opportunities to sit &#x201c;third chair&#x201d; in a trial, or to help &#x201c;put the deal together.&#x201d; Be clear, though: These are the exceptions, not the rule. The road to partnership is paved with disillusioned associates who became bored and disenchanted with the work they were given and left voluntarily, or who, after seven years spent toiling in the mines, were told that they were not on the partner track and should look elsewhere for employment. In a typical large firm, of an entering class of forty to eighty associates, only a small handful, maybe three to five, will survive to make partner eight or ten years later. <br>Hey, you! Yeah, you&#x2014;the one with the distressed look on your face about to reach for that copy of&nbsp; <i>Med School Confidential</i>&nbsp;instead. Relax. It&#x2019;s not all bad. It&#x2019;s just that there are so many people out there with misconceptions about law practice that we need to clear away the delusions up front to approach this experience with more realistic expectations. Now that we&#x2019;ve done this, it&#x2019;s time for more introspection. Let&#x2019;s explore whether you have an accurate picture of what your law school experience will entail. As you read the questions that follow, carefully consider the answers that come from within. Pay particular attention if a &#x201c;Yeah, but&#x2026;&#x201d; comes up. Trust me&#x2014;it&#x2019;s better to deal with this crisis now than to experience it a month into your first semester. <br>A REALISTIC EVALUATION OF YOUR FITNESS FOR LAW SCHOOL <br>Go somewhere where you can be undisturbed for the next thirty minutes or so and force yourself to answer the following questions honestly. What follows is a realistic picture of the day-to-day grind of law school. In many ways, it&#x2019;s also an accurate picture of the day-to-day life of a young lawyer. So forget the glamorous pictures of law practice you&#x2019;ve seen on television and in the movies and be honest with yourself. While few people will find themselves completely in love with the thought of spending their next three years holed up in a library, if what you see below is too far out of sync with what drives you, your misery may last much longer than the three years you&#x2019;ll be in school. <br>&#x2022; How comfortable are you with the idea of spending the majority of each day in silence, reading difficult material? <br>&#x2022; Do you or could you have the stamina to read dry, complicated material for four to six hours a day, every day? <br>&#x2022; Are you self-reliant, or do you depend on others for constant encouragement, evaluation, and/or affirmation? <br>&#x2022; Can you seize the main points of an assignment and move on, or do you typically get hopelessly bogged down in detail? <br>&#x2022; Are you disciplined enough to get up and attend classes every day? <br>&#x2022; Are you comfortable speaking out in class and arguing in front of others? <br>&#x2022; Have you been able to &#x201c;will&#x201d; yourself through difficult periods in your life? <br>&#x2022; When you don&#x2019;t understand something, are you capable of teaching yourself? <br>&#x2022; Do you enjoy doing research, searching through books in a library or online databases, for pieces to a puzzle or &#x201c;the answer&#x201d; to a problem? <br>&#x2022; Do you like to write critically and analytically? <br>&#x2022; Is your personality more proactive than reactive? <br>&#x2022; When you&#x2019;ve given your best effort, will you be able to sleep at night knowing that you&#x2019;ve done the best you could, or are you more likely to beat yourself up wondering if there was more you could have done? <br>&#x2022; Are you ready to make the law your life for the next three years by subverting most of your hobbies, other interests, and your social life to serious academic dedication? <br>It&#x2019;s probably obvious from the way these questions were worded, but you&#x2019;re looking for mostly yes responses&#x2014;or at least the probability that you&#x2019;ll be able to work up to yes responses on each of these questions. If you&#x2019;ve had too many &#x201c;oh-ohs&#x201d; during this evaluation, you should take that as a warning. For example, if you don&#x2019;t like to read, you&#x2019;re making a big mistake applying to...</p><h2>Child Development From Infancy to Adolescence: An Active Learning Approach</h2><p><p>This exciting chronological introduction to child development employs the lauded active learning approach of Laura E.

These new essays extend his investigations of the instability of the physical text. McGann shows how every text enters the world under socio-historical conditions that set the stage for a ceaseless process of textual development and mutation. Arguing that textuality is a matter of inscription and articulation, he explores texts as material and social phenomena, as particular kinds of acts. McGann links his study to contextual and institutional studies of literary works as they are generated over time by authors, editors, typographers, book designers, marketing planners, and other publishing agents. This enables him to examine issues of textual stability and instability in the arenas of textual production and reproduction. Drawing on literary examples from the past two centuries--including works by Byron, Blake, Morris, Yeats, Joyce, and especially Pound--McGann applies his theory to key problems facing anyone who studies texts and textuality.</p></p><p>This book is an inquiry into the nature of texts and textuality. The inquiry is grounded in the thought that texts represent--are in themselves--certain kinds of human acts.</p><h2>Introduction to Diagnostic Microbiology for the Laboratory Sciences</h2><p>Introduction to Diagnostic Microbiology for the Laboratory Sciences provides a foundation in microbiology that is essential for a career as a medical laboratory technologist/technician (MLT).

Much has been written on the men who make up the vast majority of the nation&#x2019;s two million inmates. But what of the women they leave behind? <i>Doing Time Together</i> vividly details the ways that prisons shape and infiltrate the lives of women with husbands, fianc�s, and boyfriends on the inside.<br> <br> Megan Comfort spent years getting to know women visiting men at San Quentin State Prison, observing how their romantic relationships drew them into contact with the penitentiary. Tangling with the prison&#x2019;s intrusive scrutiny and rigid rules turns these women into &#x201c;quasi-inmates,&#x201d; eroding the boundary between home and prison and altering their sense of intimacy, love, and justice. Yet Comfort also finds that with social welfare weakened, prisons are the most powerful public institutions available to women struggling to overcome untreated social ills and sustain relationships with marginalized men. As a result, they express great ambivalence about the prison and the control it exerts over their daily lives.<br> <br> An illuminating analysis of women caught in the shadow of America&#x2019;s massive prison system, Comfort&#x2019;s book will be essential for anyone concerned with the consequences of our punitive culture.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Megan Comfort</b> is a sociologist at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies at the University of California, San Francisco.&#x201c;In this meticulous ethnography, Megan Comfort documents how the wives and girlfriends of inmates experience, directly and vicariously, the pains of confinement and the humiliations of imprisonment.&nbsp;But she also shows how these women rework their ideals of romance and relationships to adapt to the realities of prison, and, most remarkably, how they sometimes use their partner&#x2019;s incarceration to their advantage in shaping the terms of their relationships. This beautifully written book does a brilliant job of tracing this, and other, complex truths in a detached, detailed, and thoroughly insightful manner.&#x201d;--David Garland, author of <i>The Culture of Control</i> (David Garland 2007-03-26)<br><br>&#x201c;Megan Comfort&#x2019;s book on how a large correctional facility changes the behavior of women partners of prisoners is a tour de force. <i>Doing Time Together</i> is one of those rare studies with information and insights that are totally new and surprising. This well-written and engaging book will be widely read and could become a classic.&#x201d; (William Julius Wilson, author of When Work Disappears 2007-12-07)<br><br>&#x201c;Ninety-three percent of the nation&#x2019;s prisoners are men. So what happens to their wives and girlfriends? In her deeply insightful and beautifully written book, Megan Comfort gives us an unexpected answer. With their endless pre-visit waits in the &#x2018;tube,&#x2019; dreaded encounters with hostile guards, and strict rules on clothing, they are &#x2018;convicted&#x2019; too. But paradoxically, prison can also make once-violent or drug-addicted men into more stable, loyal, and loving partners. We put down this brilliant book wondering where the women&#x2019;s prison really is&#x2014;in or outside the prison walls?&#x201d; (Arlie Hochschild, author of The Commercialization of Intimate Life 2007-12-07)<br><br>&#x201c;"[Comfort's] findings should astound readers who might tend to look at these women as lacking in good judgment. . . . People concerned with prisoners&#x2019; rights and women&#x2019;s struggles will find much food for thought here. . . . Comfort&#x2019;s description of the transition between the free world and the prison world is a little gem.&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i> 2007-12-07)<br><br>"The depth and authenticity of [Comfort's] fieldwork, and the constant weaving in of the women's stories, makes this book much more than just an academic text. . . . A rich and thoroughly engaging book that illuminates hitherto hidden consequences of both the US and UK punitiv eculture and should cause policy-makers to reconsider the purpose of imprisonment and who indeed is being punished."

And yet, historian Rosemary Ashton reveals in this compelling microhistory, 1858 was marked by significant, if unrecognized, turning points. For ordinary people, and also for the rich, famous, and powerful, the months from May to August turned out to be a summer of consequence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ashton mines Victorian letters and gossip, diaries, court records, newspapers, and other contemporary sources to uncover historically crucial moments in the lives of three protagonists&#x2014;Charles Dickens, Charles Darwin, and Benjamin Disraeli. She also introduces others who gained renown in the headlines of the day, among them George Eliot, Karl Marx, William Thackeray, and Edward Bulwer Lytton. Ashton reveals invisible threads of connection among Londoners at every social level in 1858, bringing the celebrated city and its citizens vibrantly to life.</p><p>Other than record-breaking summer heat and the related stench of the sewage-filled Thames River, events in London in 1858 were unremarkable. Or were they? This deeply researched book uncovers crucial moments in the lives of Victorian Londoners both famous and forgotten and reveals the lasting significance of their scandals, disgraces, and achievements.<b>Rosemary Ashton </b>is Emeritus Quain Professor of English Language and Literature, University College London.

During the service, a stranger enters and addresses the gathering. He tells the patriotic crowd that their prayers for victory are double-edged-by praying for victory they are also praying for the destruction of the enemy... for the destruction of human life. </p><p>Originally rejected for publication in 1905 as "not quite suited to a woman's magazine," this antiwar parable remained unpublished until 1923, when Twain's literary executor collected it in the volume <em>Europe and Elsewhere</em>.

Maybe a lot!</p> <p>In the book, I cover one of the bigger and more common mistakes investors make: Thinking about time horizon wrong. They often think, "I'm 60 and retiring at 65, therefore my investing time horizon is just five years, which is short so I should play everything very, very safe." The best way to think about time horizon isn't "How old am I?" but "How long must my money work toward my goals?" For many investors, this is the entirety of their lives and that of a spouse which can be a very long time.</p> <p>While younger folks may know they have long time horizons, those approaching retirement don't necessarily have short ones. A 60-year-old investor could easily live to be 90-30 years! And what if that 60 year old is married to a healthy, active 50-year-old? Now, their investing time horizon could be 40 years or more, if you consider all the life-extending medical advancements that happen over the next 4 decades.</p> <strong>What are the biggest pitfalls or traps investors fall into?</strong> <p>As mentioned, one huge pitfall is assuming too short a time horizon. This can lead to another trap-failing to plan for enough growth. Investors often forget the long-term devastating impact inflation can have, or they underestimate how much cash flow they need in later retirement, or a combination of the two. And if they fail to plan for enough growth to outpace inflation and achieve their long-term goals, they may find they must ratchet back their style of living late in life which is brutally tough and tougher to explain to a spouse.</p> <p>The worst part of failing to plan for enough growth is it may be non-evident for a long time--maybe 10 or 20 years! By then, it is too late to do much about it.</p> <p>The book covers a bunch of other common pitfalls, like: believing volatility is the only risk that matters, relying on high-dividend stocks only for retirement cash flow, having unrealistic expectations, and more.</p> <strong>If you had only one piece of advice to offer investors of all ages, what would it be?</strong> <p>Believe, with your very soul, in capitalism and the power of the profit motive to do good. Profit motive is a powerful source for societal good which has led to life-extending-and-improving innovations like vaccines, better medical procedures, safer cars, faster computers, the entire information age and increased wealth on average. It's also the reason why, long-term, stocks are likeliest to yield superior returns to every other similarly liquid asset class.</p> <p>Also, never forget the power of compounding returns-a bit of magic most people underestimate, which I cover in the book.</p> <strong>What do you say to young investors who are scared to invest in stocks after witnessing years like 2001 and 2008?</strong> <p>Simply, that even huge bear markets like 2001 and 2008 eventually become mere blips after a decade or so of equity like returns. Bull market upside is much huger and much more frequent than bear market downside--eventually.</p> <p>If you believe in capitalism (you should), you know the long-term superior return of equities includes down periods. Bear markets happen. They will happen again. Some will be bigger than others. But after every bear market comes a bull--and since the Great Depression, every bull market has hit new highs. So as long as you don't panic and make a big move in the depths of a bear market that makes you miss out on a material chunk of the ensuing bull market, a bear market can't hurt you if you have a long time horizon.</p> <p>Get that in your bones, and you'll do better than most all investors, including most professionals.</p> <strong>Is there a "magic formula" when saving for retirement? What are the main variables people need to think about to determine how much they will really need in retirement?</strong> <p>I abhor magic formulas. There's no such thing. Anyone telling you otherwise likely wants to sell you something bad for you.</p> <p>The book covers the main concepts you should consider when crafting your retirement investing plan--these include careful consideration of your time horizons, return expectations, cash flow needs, your current financial situation and any other circumstances unique to you. The key to successful retirement investing planning is selecting an appropriate benchmark. The book walks you through this process and gives you helpful exercises. But if you want good long-term results, there are no short-cuts to this deliberate process. But the book shows you how.</p><p>Think you're too young to start thinking about retirement? Or that "retirement" investing is different from "normal" investing? Think again. </p><p>Whether you're in retirement, just getting ready to retire now or in 5, 10 or 40 years, <i>Plan Your Prosperity</i> arms you with information, expert guidance and tools to help you invest smarter your whole life and, yes, plan better for retirement. Bestselling finance author Ken Fisher explains why, for all practical purposes and for most investors, <i>all</i> investing should be done with an eye toward retirement--and beyond. </p><p>Harmful mythology abounds about retirement investing. Like the adage you should take 100 (or 120) and subtract your age to get your equity allocation and put the rest in bonds or cash. Or you should buy only bonds. Or buy only high-dividend stocks. Or some combination! Or buy equity-indexed annuities or some "guaranteed" income product. All are examples of potentially harmful myths many folks believe to be smart, strategic moves--myths Ken makes short work of in <i>Plan Your Prosperity.</i> </p><p>In their place, Ken provides straightforward principles to help you increase the odds you achieve your long-term investing goals, like: </p><li>How to think correctly about investing time horizon</li> <li>The difference between income and cash flow</li> <li>How to better figure how much cash flow you need and if your portfolio can provide it</li> <li>How to figure how much to save each year to achieve retirement goals</li> <li>What pitfalls to avoid</li> <li>And more . . .</li> <p>Not another one-size-fits-all retirement planner, <i>Plan Your Prosperity</i> supplies you with a firm foundation in sound investment and retirement planning principles. And it gives you a framework for better understanding your financial needs, setting your financial goals and creating a workable plan for your lifelong prosperity.</p></p><h2>The Vagina Monologues</h2><p>"I was worried about vaginas. I was worried about what we think about vaginas, and even more worried that we don't think about them. . . . So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas, to do vagina interviews, which became vagina monologues. I talked with over two hundred women. I talked to old women, young women, married women, single women, lesbians, college professors, actors, corporate professionals, sex workers, African American women, Hispanic women, Asian American women, Native American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women. At first women were reluctant to talk. They were a little shy. But once they got going, you couldn't stop them."<br><br>So begins Eve Ensler's hilarious, eye-opening tour into the last frontier, the forbidden zone at the heart of every woman. Adapted from the award-winning one-woman show that's rocked audiences around the world, this groundbreaking book gives voice to a chorus of lusty, outrageous, poignant, and thoroughly human stories, transforming the question mark hovering over the female anatomy into a permanent victory sign. With laughter and compassion, Ensler transports her audiences to a world we've never dared to know, guaranteeing that no one who reads The Vagina Monologues will ever look at a woman's body the same way again.</p><p>"I say vagina because I want people to respond," says playwright Eve Ensler, creator of the hilarious, disturbing soliloquies in <i>The Vagina Monologues</i>, a book based on her one-woman play. And respond they do--with horror, anger, censure, and sparks of wonder and pleasure. Ensler is on a fervent mission to elevate and celebrate this much mumbled-about body part. She asked hundreds of women of all ages a series of questions about their vaginas (What do you call it? How would you dress it?) that prompt some wondrous answers. Standouts among the euphemisms are tamale, split knish, choochi snorcher, Gladys Siegelman--<i>Gladys Siegelman?</i>--and, of course, that old standby "down there." "Down there?" asks a composite character springing from several older women. "I haven't been down there since 1953. No, it had nothing to do with [American president] Eisenhower." Two of the most powerful pieces include a jagged poem stitched together from the memories of a Bosnian woman raped by soldiers and an American woman sexually abused as a child who reclaims her vagina as a place of wild joy.Praise for Eve Ensler and The Vagina Monologues<br><br>"The special genius of The Vagina Monologues is Eve Ensler's ability to lead her audience to lost, discarded, and wounded parts of themselves, and make them shout, weep, and finally howl with laughter."<br>--Sapphire, poet and author of Push<br><br>"The language has the intensity of poetry. . . . Ensler punctuates [the monologues] hilariously, eliciting roars from the audience. . . . Cunning writing."<br>--The New York Times<br><br>"Ensler . . . has the happy ability to marry less-than-conventional politics with more-than-approachable humor."<br>--Mirabella<br><br>"Eve Ensler has written a revolutionary piece of theater on what one might call a 'taboo' subject.

It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre. Dodgson's tale was published in 1865 as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by "Lewis Carroll" with illustrations by John Tenniel. The first print run of 2,000 was held back because Tenniel objected to the print quality. A new edition was quickly printed, released in December of the same year but carrying an 1866 date. The entire print run sold out quickly. Alice was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Among its first avid readers were Queen Victoria and the young Oscar Wilde. The book has never been out of print. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has been translated into at least 174 languages. There have now been over a hundred English-language editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, especially theatre and film.</p></p><p>Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson who was born 27 January 1832. He was an English writer, mathematician, logician, Anglican deacon and photographer. His most famous writings are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, as well as the poems "The Hunting of the Snark" and "Jabberwocky", all examples of the genre of literary nonsense. He is noted for his facility at word play, logic, and fantasy, and there are societies in many parts of the world (including the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, and New Zealand dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works and the investigation of his life.

His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously.<br><br>Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, <b>The Marble Faun</b>, at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, <b>Soldier&#x2019;s Pay</b>, was published in 1926, followed a year later by <b>Mosquitoes</b>, a literary satire. His next book, <b>Flags in the Dust</b>, was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher&#x2019;s insistence and appeared finally as <b>Sartoris</b> in 1929. In the meantime he had completed <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>, and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished <b>Sanctuary</b> and was ready to begin writing <b>As I Lay Dying</b>. That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier.<br><br>Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels&#x2014;<b>Light in August</b> (1932), <b>Pylon</b> (1935), <b>Absalom, Absalom!</b> (1936), <b>The Unvanquished</b> (1938), <b>The Wild Palms</b> (1939), <b>The Hamlet</b> (1940), and <b>Go Down, Moses</b> (1942)&#x2014;and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on <b>To Have and Have Not</b>, <b>The Big Sleep</b>, and <b>Land of the Pharaohs</b>, among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology <b>The Portable Faulkner</b> brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature.<br><br>Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>. &#x201c;No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner&#x2019;s imagination,&#x201d; Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley&#x2019;s anthology. &#x201c;The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers&#x2014;all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations.&#x201d; In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books&#x2014;<b>Intruder in the Dust</b> (1948), <b>Requiem for a Nun</b> (1951), <b>A Fable</b> (1954), <b>The Town</b> (1957), <b>The Mansion</b> (1959), and <b>The Reivers</b> (1962)&#x2014;he continued to explore what he had called &#x201c;the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,&#x201d; but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha&#x2019;s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.</p><h2>Compiler Construction: Principles and Practice</h2><p>Compiler Construction: Principles and Practice features a comprehensive, hands-on case study project for constructing an actual, working compiler.</p><p>Kenneth C.

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

As the final barrier to the fully nude body, it is simultaneously modest and erotic. This compelling and eye-catching publication surveys lingerie from the mid-18th century to the present, covering a broad range of foundation garments, intimate apparel, and lounging clothes&#x2014;from bras and corsets to slips, peignoirs, and tea gowns. All pieces are gorgeously illustrated in color.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stunning historical garments from well-known fashion houses such as Christian Dior are included, as is risqu� contemporary lingerie by labels such as Agent Provocateur. When viewed as a whole, these pieces illustrate important developments in fashion over time, such as changes in silhouette, shifting ideals of propriety, and advancements in technology.<br> &nbsp;<br> While a number of the pieces featured in the book were worn hundreds of years ago, the majority date from the 20th century. It was at that time that lingerie started to become as beautiful and alluring as it was functional. Authors Colleen Hill and Valerie Steele show that the decorative, highly feminine styles from the early 1900s set a new precedent for the importance of lingerie in women&#x2019;s private lives&#x2014;a concept that remains important to many women today.&nbsp;</p><p>Lingerie, an enduringly fascinating subject, is revered in this gorgeous survey of immaculately crafted undergarments from the 18th century to the present.<br><b>Colleen Hill </b>is associate curator of accessories and <b>Valerie Steele </b>is director and chief curator, both at The Museum at FIT.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Letters of Robert Frost, Volume 1: 1886&#x2013;1920</h2><p><p>One of the acknowledged giants of twentieth-century American literature, Robert Frost was a public figure much celebrated in his day. Although his poetry reached a wide audience, the private Frost&#x2015;pensive, mercurial, and often very funny&#x2015;remains less appreciated. Following upon the publication of Frost&#x2019;s notebooks and collected prose, <i>The Letters of Robert Frost</i> is the first major edition of the poet&#x2019;s written correspondence. The hundreds of previously unpublished letters in these annotated volumes deepen our understanding and appreciation of this most complex and subtle of verbal artists.</p><p>Volume One traverses the years of Frost&#x2019;s earliest poems to the acclaimed collections <i>North of Boston</i> and <i>Mountain Interval</i> that cemented his reputation as one of the leading lights of his era. The drama of his personal life&#x2015;as well as the growth of the audacious mind that produced his poetry&#x2015;unfolds before us in Frost&#x2019;s day-to-day missives. These rhetorical performances are at once revealing and tantalizingly evasive about relationships with family and close friends, including the poet Edward Thomas. We listen in as Frost defines himself against contemporaries Ezra Pound and William Butler Yeats, and we witness the evolution of his thoughts about prosody, sound, style, and other aspects of poetic craft.</p><p>In its literary interest and sheer display of personality, Frost&#x2019;s correspondence is on a par with the letters of Emily Dickinson, Robert Lowell, and Samuel Beckett. <i>The Letters of Robert Frost</i> holds hours of pleasurable reading for lovers of Frost and modern American poetry.</p></p><p>Donald Sheehy is Professor of English at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.This opening volume of a complete edition of <b>Frost</b>&#x2019;s letters meanders from a schoolboy&#x2019;s love notes (&#x2018;I have got read a composition after recess and I hate to offaly&#x2019;) to the dashed valedictions of the poet at 45, fleeing a cushy job at Amherst. Generously annotated, it replaces the selected letters edited by Lawrance Thompson half a century ago... In almost every way, this new edition is a triumph of scholarly care... The notes are as thorough as most readers could wish... For all his private flaws, his tragedies large and small, American literature&#x2015;and the language itself&#x2015;owes a profound debt to that dark, demonic, beguiling figure, Robert Frost. (William Logan <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2014-06-22)<br><br>It can sometimes seem, from the surfeit of images of <b>Frost</b> in his later years, that he was born old, incapable of youth in the same way John Keats is incapable of age. <i>The Letters of Robert Frost, Volume I: 1886&#x2013;1920</i>, edited by <b>Donald Sheehy</b>, <b>Mark Richardson</b>, and <b>Robert Faggen</b>, part of a heroic effort by Harvard University Press to collect all Frost&#x2019;s writings in a definitive edition, goes some way toward filling this imaginative deficit... These letters [show] Frost at home in metaphor, if nowhere else... His own oppositional modernism was as revolutionary as Eliot&#x2019;s. (Dan Chiasson <i>New Yorker</i> 2014-02-10)<br><br>Long overdue, <i>The Letters of Robert Frost, Volume I: 1886&#x2013;1920</i> is deservedly getting a lot of attention. <b>Frost</b> is not simply a lively correspondent, he is an artist of the epistolary form, defining himself and his poetic era in these pages. The trio of editors, <b>Donald Sheehy</b>, <b>Mark Richardson</b>, and <b>Robert Faggen</b>, have done a splendid job, bringing into print all of the known letters from this period, silently correcting obvious typos, offering helpful annotations in ample headnotes and footnotes... The truly original, splenetic, aphoristic, and revisionary mind of a major poet comes into view... No reader will come away from this volume without a quickened sense of the poet&#x2019;s greatness in the face of his obvious failings as a human being. His unique, almost ferocious, intelligence shines on every page of these letters. (Jay Parini <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> 2014-02-17)<br><br>Such a joy to read... This is the first time a complete version of [<b>Frost</b>&#x2019;s letters]&#x2015;running in chronological order&#x2015;has been made available. Frost saw these noble exchanges almost like an art form: one where he could deconstruct his own work, and the work of others, with precision and intellectual rigor... Through them, we get a deep insight into Frost&#x2019;s views on: the mechanics of poetry; politics; the art of conversation; and the importance of structure and syntax in language... These letters give us greater insight into Frost the poet, and Frost the man, and they are a fitting testament to his exceptional work ethic as a writer. Anyone interested in the laborious process an artist must undertake to perfect his craft will read this book with awe and fascination, and as a constant source of inspiration. (J. P. O&#x2019;Malley <i>NPR online</i> 2014-02-13)<br><br><i>The Letters of Robert Frost, Volume I, 1886&#x2013;1920</i> is a staggering effort by the three editors&#x2015;<b>Donald Sheehy</b>, <b>Mark Richardson</b> and <b>Robert Faggen</b>&#x2015;and Harvard University Press to present, for the first time, the entire collection of all of <b>Frost</b>&#x2019;s preserved correspondence. What&#x2019;s unique about this effort is that there&#x2019;s no discernible bias made by the editors; instead, their expectation, as suggested in the preface, is that unlike prior biographies and incomplete collections of correspondence, &#x2018;the availability of the correspondence in its entirety will present both an occasion and a means to come to know Robert Frost anew.&#x2019; [It&#x2019;s] a collection so massive that casual readers may look at its fatty binding and flee in terror with memories of being forced to read Boswell&#x2019;s <i>Life of Johnson</i>, Joyce&#x2019;s <i>Ulysses</i> or Wallace&#x2019;s <i>Infinite Jest</i>. But those people would be mistaken; while visibly daunting, <i>The Letters of Robert Frost</i> should be read by everyone. (Shyam K. Sriram <i>PopMatters</i> 2014-06-19)<br><br>Overall, the letters show <b>Frost</b> to be a mature artist, a good friend, and a caring husband and father...The introduction, chronology, index of correspondents, and helpful contextual notes make these letters both accessible and enjoyable for anyone interested in Frost. How could it be otherwise for a poet who always wrote for the many and the few? (Micah Mattix <i>Weekly Standard</i> 2014-05-05)<br><br>The <b>Frost</b> who emerges from his letters can come across as vain, defensive, ingratiating, stubborn....But what redeems Frost is his acute awareness of his own deficiencies of character--along with his lively sense of humor. Like his poems, his letters can be playful and teasing. Others read like drafts of lectures, in which he tries out his ideas about poetry. They take us back to an era when letter-writing was the next best thing to a conversation beside the fireplace. Frost meant his letters to do what Horace said poetry should do--please and instruct their readers. Thanks to the labors of Donald Sheehy, Mark Richardson, and Robert Faggen, they can now please and instruct us as well, even though we don&#x2019;t write letters anymore. (Mark Walhout <i>Books &amp; Culture</i> 2014-05-01)<br><br>To remove some of the confusion surrounding <b>Frost</b> himself is among the editors&#x2019; aims in this first of four planned volumes of his complete letters. It continues the commendable project by Harvard University Press of bringing into print all the primary material of one of America&#x2019;s most important 20th-century poets...Judging by this first volume, which takes us up to Frost at age 46 (he was born in 1874), he comes across very well: sympathetic, funny, self-deprecating, and both loyal and caring towards family and friends. (Simon West <i>The Australian</i> 2014-05-24)<br><br>Writers, in particular, are revealed through traditional correspondence. Thanks to Harvard&#x2019;s undertaking, <b>Frost</b>&#x2019;s more complete, chronological letters help correct the poet&#x2019;s legacy by allowing it weight and breadth. (Valerie Duff <i>Boston Globe</i> 2014-03-01)<br><br><i>The Letters of Robert Frost</i> [is] a projected four-volume edition of all the poet&#x2019;s known correspondence that promises to offer the most rounded, complete portrait to date...The complete correspondence, scholars say, will show <b>Frost</b> in full, revealing a complex man who juggled uncommon fame with an uncommonly difficult private life (including four children who died before him, one a suicide), a canny self-fashioner who may have cultivated the image of a birch-swinging rustic but was as much the modernist innovator as T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound...If there&#x2019;s a true revelation in the first volume, the editors say, it&#x2019;s the sheer intellectual firepower Frost brings even to a casual missive, the range of references that can wind playfully from George Bernard Shaw to Gothic architecture to Neolithic archaeology, all in a few hundred words.

All of these qualities are on display in Mansfield's writing, as well; hers are lonely tales of missed connections, inchoate longings, and complicated emotions within the context of a rigidly defined social setting. Born in New Zealand, Mansfield set many of her stories there, even though she emigrated to England in 1908 at age 19, never to return. Her characters are almost invariably middle-class, the daughters, sweethearts, wives, and widows of office clerks, military men, businessmen. In "At the Bay," for example, Mansfield focuses on the Burnell family as they take their summer vacation at the beach. Not content to follow just one character through the story, she drifts in and out of the consciousness of half a dozen, from the family cat to Stanley and Linda Burnell, their children, Linda's sister, Beryl and their in-laws, the Trouts. Dipping into Linda's thoughts, for example, we learn that she loves her husband--"not the Stanley whom everyone saw, not the everyday one; but a timid, sensitive, innocent Stanley who knelt down every night to say his prayers and who longed to be good." Unfortunately for Linda, "she saw <i>her</i> Stanley so seldom." Mansfield then swoops into the mind of Stanley's brother-in-law, Jonathan Trout, who is discontented with his life but knows he hasn't the will to change it, and then on to Beryl, whose longing for "someone who will find the Beryl they none of them know" leads her into a rash action.<p> In the title story, Mansfield concentrates on young Laura Sheridan on the afternoon of her family's garden party. The story follows the family through the preparations--flags to identify the different sandwiches, the delivery of cream puffs, the setting up of a marquee on the lawn. This perfect idyll is broken, however, by news of a fatal accident down the lane. A young workman has been killed, leaving a wife and five children. Into Laura's perfect Eden, death comes whispering and her reaction to it is both subtle and surprising. In fact, many of Mansfield's stories feature young women on the brink of adulthood--facing, for the first time, the realities of their constricted lives. Love is a trap; childbearing is another; death can be "simply marvellous." Mansfield died in 1923 of tuberculosis, leaving behind a body of work that is as bold, unconventional, and modern as she was. <i>The Garden Party and Other Stories</i> is a fitting epitaph. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Introduction by Claire Tomalin</p><h2>Mathematical Thinking: Problem-Solving and Proofs (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This survey of both discrete and continuous mathematics focuses on <i>the logical thinking skills</i> necessary to understand and communicate fundamental ideas and proofs in mathematics, rather than on rote symbolic manipulation.

The reason is simple: no matter what you think you're saying, your words, gestures, and tone of voice can actually communicate something entirely different. </p><p>Too often, negative micromessages undermine morale, business opportunities, and ultimately your organization. <i>Micromessaging</i> examines the nuanced behaviors that we all blindly use and react to in our dealings with others. Yet as Young points out, these micromessages can reveal a lot about our own-and our superiors'-biases and preconceived notions. Learning how to constructively address these behaviors can bring about positive change.</p> <p>Young offers a common language for encouraging open discussion in the workplace, along with skills to identify and address familiar micromessages; tools for deploying microadvantages; and real-life workplace scenarios, self-assessments, and solutions that help readers interpret and alter ingrained behaviors and their effects. He delivers valuable information on</p> <ul> <li>Cruicial leadership skills and how to acquire them </li><li>Universal workplace cultural issues </li><li>How expectations affect the performance of others </li><li>Ways to speak fairly, not falsely </li><li>Techniques that eliminate group think </li><li>How to reset the "filters" you use to "screen" others </li></ul> <p>Based on research from MIT, Young's approach has already helped numerous Fortune 500 clients, including Merck, Intel, Lockheed Martin, Starbucks, IBM, Boeing, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Cisco, and Raytheon to increase leadership effectiveness. With its proven wisdom, you can experience what so many business executives worldwide have discovered and make it a powerful part of your leadership skill set.</p></p><p><p>For more than a decade, organizational guru <b>Stephen Young</b> has brought his powerful message about micromessaging and leadership to executives in businesses spanning fifteen countries. In 2002, Young founded Insight Education Systems, a management consulting firm specializing in leadership and organizational development, applying these concepts to nearly 10% of the Fortune 500 and many of their CEOs and leadership teams. Previously, as Senior Vice President at JP Morgan Chase he managed the firm's worldwide diversity strategy. Under his leadership, the company garnered numerous awards including the Catalyst Award and <i>Fortune</i> magazine's list of Top 50 Companies for Minorities, and it was ranked as the #1 company for diversity by <i>Inc.</i> magazine.</p><p><b>Change the way you do business with the nonverbal gestures that can make or break any business relationship</b></p><p>A blank look, an averted gaze, or a dismissive shrug . . . we all know how other people's nonverbal cues can make us feel, even if they are delivered or received without conscious awareness. But do you know the ways in which these subtle behaviors can define your ability to influence the performance of others for better-or worse?</p><p>Stephen Young, one of the foremost experts on leadership, introduces the concept of micromessages-the gestures, facial expressions, tones of voice, word choices, eye contact, and interactive nuances that can be either debilitating or empowering to employees and to the power of leadership. Once you understand these micromessages, you'll be able to improve your leadership skills by</p><ul><li>Getting inside your organization's cultural DNA to spark change</li><li>Diffusing negative micromessages (microinequities) and use positive micromessages (microadvantages) to spark creativity, improve performance, and exceed goals</li><li>Infusing positive micromessages at all levels of the organization, achieving a strong, inclusive, and high-performing work environment</li></ul></p><h2>The Muscle and Bone Palpation Manual with Trigger Points, Referral Patterns and Stretching</h2><p>With more than 1,000 vibrant, full-color illustrations and over 4 hours of detailed video demonstrations, THE MUSCLE AND BONE PALPATION MANUAL is the most visually engaging way to help you master and successfully apply palpation techniques in massage therapy.

It is amply illustrated and is complemented by a DVD. It is designed to fill a need in the training of students of massage therapy. It focuses attention on human muscles, their anatomy, and the most effective way in which each muscle should be palpated. There is an additional emphasis on stretching and on trigger points. A book like this is needed in the discipline, and its thoroughness will be an asset in marketing to other professions in manual therapy. Overall, it does a superb job of meeting the authors' objectives. The primary audience is students in massage therapy programs, but it will also find a home in other professions which focus on manual care, such as chiropractic, naturopathy, napropathy and physical medicine. It is a book that students will embrace, but it is probably a bit basic for practitioners, although it might be a good reference for them. The first of the three main parts of the book looks at the art and science of palpation, as well as some information about stretching (from various viewpoints, such as contract relax and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation). The second part looks at bony palpation and landmarks in the body, while the final part (which is the meat of the book) provides detailed information on how to palpate all muscles of the body. It is wonderfully illustrated, with hundreds of high quality illustrations, and the accompanying DVD demonstrates many of the techniques as well. All illustrations are in color, and the text looks quite professional. My only quibble is a lack of referencing for the latter chapters, which may reflect the fact that the book represents the clinical wisdom of the authors. This is a nicely done addition to the literature. It is logically organized, it covers the material well, and I cannot think of another similar book that has this level of detail. The DVD is a good addition. There is a wealth of good clinical information here, well beyond just the palpation skills. There is good information on stretching, and on trigger points and where they may be located and how they may be palpated. I would feel quite comfortable recommending this book to my chiropractic students. ----------------------------------------------------------- Weighted Numerical Score: 95 - 4 Stars!</p> <p>"This book is a comprehensive introduction to learning the skills required to be an effective body worker or massage therapist.

Whether by directing the flow of natural light, embedding artificial light within objects or architecture, or playing with light through the use of reflective, translucent, or transparent materials, each of these artists created situations capable of stimulating heightened sensory awareness in the receptive viewer. <i>Phenomenal: California Light, Space, Surface</i>, companion book to the exhibition of the same name, explores and documents the unique traits of the phenomenologically engaged work produced in Southern California during those decades and traces its ongoing influence on current generations of international artists.<br><br> Foreword by Hugh M.

Eisenhower had assumed the dual role of supreme commander. Monty wanted the ground commander job for himself and felt that Ike was unequal to the supreme commander job. The last half of the book details Monty's years as commander of the British zone in Germany and chief of the Imperial General Staff, and his part in the dissolution of the British Empire.

International in its coverage, these volumes bring together the poets and poetry movements that radically altered the ways that art and language express the human condition. <i>Volume 2</i> offers a dazzling chronicle of the second "great awakening" of experimental poetry in the twentieth century. Ranging from the period of World War II through the cold war to the onset of the twenty-first century, this volume presents two "galleries" of individual poets such as Holan, Olson, Rukeyser, Jab�s, Celan, Mac Low, Pasolini, Bachmann, Finlay, Ginsberg, Adonis, Rich, U Tam'si, Baraka, Takahashi, Waldman, and Bei Dao. There are also samplings of local and international movements: the Beats, the Vienna Group, the Cobra poets and artists, the Arabic-language Tammuzi poets, the creators of a new "Concrete Poetry," the "postwar poets" of Japan, the Italian Novissimi and Avan-Guardia, the Chinese Misty Poets, and the North American Language Poets. In addition, an extended section is devoted to examples of the "art of the manifesto" and two smaller groupings of traditional "oral poets" and of experimenters with machine art and cyberpoetics. Poet-editors Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris provide informative and irreverent commentaries throughout. They challenge old truths and propose alternative directions, in the tradition of the manifestos that have marked the art and poetry of the twentieth century. The result is both an essential resource for experiencing the full range of contemporary poetic possibilities and an arresting statement on the future of poetry in the millennium ahead.</p><p>Praise for Volume 1: "The word anthology hardly does justice to Rothenberg and Joris's brilliant reconceptualization of twentieth-century poetry in a global context. This is that rare book that forces us to rethink what the poetic is and can be." --Marjorie Perloff<p>"This book is destined to become a fundamental resource for the study of twentieth-century literature and culture.

It then studies the genres of silent melodrama, the musical, American comedy, the war/combat film, film noir, the western, and the horror and science fiction film, investigating the way in which movies shape and are shaped by the larger cultural concerns of the nation as a whole. The book concludes with a discussion of post World War II Hollywood, giving separate chapter coverage to the effects of the Cold War, 3D, television, the counterculture of the 1960s, directors from the film school generation, and the cultural concerns of Hollywood from the 1970s through 2011. <br><br>Ideal for Introduction to American Cinema courses, American Film History courses, and Introductory Film Appreciation courses, this text provides a <i>cultural</i> overview of the phenomenon of the American movie-going experience.<br><br>An updated study guide is also available for <i>American Cinema/American Culture</i>.

But from its formal beginnings in 1926 in Weimar Berlin until around 1970 it was almost totally secret. Most of what is known about the Order in the English-speaking world is fragmentary and focuses exclusively on the sensational sex-magic practices and Luciferian tendencies of this magical lodge.<br><br>Presenting the most in-depth work in English on the Fraternitas Saturni, Stephen Flowers examines the history of the Order from the mid-1920s to the late 1960s when the Order was fundamentally reformed. He details their path of initiation, secret doctrines, ritual practices, and magical formulas and offers biographies of the Order&#x2019;s most prominent members, including founder Gregor A. Gregorius, Karl Spiesberger (Frater Eratus), Albin Grau (Master Pacitius), and Franz Saettler (Dr. Musallam). Exploring the Brotherhood&#x2019;s guiding principles, he shows that at the heart of Saturnian ideology is the idea of Saturn-Gnosis: the interplay of opposing forces in the universe leading to the realization of the individual self as a god-like entity. He examines the Order&#x2019;s teachings on cosmology, the Kabbalah, the Saturnian Sacraments, electrical magic, sexo-cosmology, sex-magic rites, and sexual mysticism--the Yoga of the Dark Light--and transcribes many of their actual rituals and practices, including the highly controversial Gradus Pentalphae, in such detail that readers will be able to undertake their own experiential work. <br><br>Explaining the meanings of all 33 grades of the Order, the author also looks at the infamous Freemasonic Order of the Golden Centurium, the cult of Adonism, the links between Thelema and the Fraternitas Saturni, and the rare teachings of Master Pacitius (Albin Grau), the visual genius behind the film Nosferatu. He also includes rare reports by Aleister Crowley concerning his interaction with some of the forerunners to the Order and letters from the Order&#x2019;s founder, Gregor A. Gregorius, to the &#x201c;Great Beast.&#x201d;</p><p>Stephen Flowers studied Germanic and Celtic philology and religious history at the University of Texas at Austin and in Goettingen, West Germany. He received his Ph.D. in 1984 in Germanic Languages and Medieval Studies with a dissertation entitled <i>Runes and Magic</i>.Chapter 2 <br><br>Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni<br><br><b>The Luciferian Principle <br></b><br>Although in later times the Luciferian aspect of the Fraternitas Saturni might have been toned down--especially in materials meant for public consumption--the ideology of Gregorius himself was permeated with this Luciferian Principle. [. . . ] In the FS, Lucifer is understood as the Light Bearer for mankind. As a result of being given this light by Lucifer, which continues to be reborn in every generation of humanity, mankind will be able to take a measure of egocentric power from the solar Logos. In this way Lucifer is the savior of humankind, at least for that part of humanity that has been able to comprehend his Principle. The essence of the Saturnian cult is the effort to understand this entity and to consciously make use of its power in the service of the solar Logos (Sorath).(48) <br><br>Gregorius was always anxious to point out that this Luciferian mythology was in fact older than the ignorant misunderstandings and willful distortions of the JudeoChristian tradition. He claimed to have his knowledge from a pre-Christian and/or non-Christian sect of &#x201c;Barbelo-Gnostics.&#x201d;(49) In the FS Lucifer is the embodiment of enlightenment and reason; there are none of the destructive slanders against him as in the Christian tradition. <br><br>However he came by it, Gregorius does seem to have a correct interpretation of the relative roles of that entity referred to as the Light-Bearer (Greek <i>Eos-phoros</i>) and that referred to as &#x201c;God.&#x201d; Perhaps the oldest version of the Lucifer myth is that of the Greek Prometheus (&#x201c;he who has foreknowledge&#x201d;). Traditions differ on many details of the Promethean mythology, but what is essential is that Prometheus, wishing to help and preserve mankind (some say he even created mankind), brought the divine fire--or higher consciousness--and bestowed it upon men. This was the first enlightenment of humanity. Zeus, however, was angered and punished Prometheus by hurling him into the depths of Erebus. There he was staked to a mountain--an image prefiguring the crucifixion by hundreds of years. The point is that the &#x201c;creator god,&#x201d; here Zeus (in the Judeo-Christian tradition Jehovah), wants to keep humanity in subjugation and slavery to the &#x201c;natural laws&#x201d; which he has set up--but a rebel figure, here Prometheus (elsewhere Lucifer), befriends man and brings him the means to become as one of the gods. This is the fundamental idea underlying the Luciferian stance of the FS and its connection to pre- and non Christian attitudes toward the myth. <br><br>Because of the general domination of the Judeo-Christian mythic scheme in medieval and post-medieval European culture, the FS also, of course, deals with the Luciferian mythos from that standpoint, taking a decidedly Ophite (or Naassene) view. The myth is most readily available in the Judeo-Christian canon in Genesis 3. A close and objective reading of this myth cannot but prove the Saturnian point: that the Serpent (Hebrew: <i>nechesh</i>) is the friend and brother of Adam, while the Lord God (Hebrew: <i>yahweh elohim</i>) is only his keeper and shepherd. The rebel spirit Lucifer opened the way for man&#x2019;s rebellion and hence his salvation; Jahweh would have held man in the eternal bondage of ignorance. The Serpent gave Knowledge (Gk. <i>Gn�sis</i>)--and thus is the true friend of mankind and his true liberator. Any other interpretation of the text of Genesis 3 would seem wildly imaginative. <br><br>Following basically Gnostic thought, the doctrines of the FS contain a Christology that is consistent with this view of the Eden myth. They would hold that the Ophite/Naassene teaching that the Serpent (Heb. <i>nechesh</i>) in the Garden of Eden and the Anointed One (Heb. <i>messiach</i>)--the Christos--are one in the same. This could be backed up with the Kabbalistic interpretation of <i>nechesh</i> =N.Ch.Sh. = 50.8.300. = 358 and <i>messiach</i> = M.Sh.Y.Ch. = 40.300.10.8. = 358. That both, according to the esoteric laws of gematria, render the sum of 358 demonstrates their essential unity. The Christos is a messenger and son of the Serpent, therefore, and not of the Creator. This Christos preaches <i>gn�sis</i> (knowledge) and not merely <i>pistis</i> (faith). The Serpent of Eden is further identified with the brazen serpent of Exodus and with the serpent-entwined staff of Hermes, the caduceus.(50) According to FS teaching, the Serpent of Eden may also be identified with Satana, the feminine aspect of Satanas. This in turn corresponds to the kundalini--serpent power--of Indian tantric lore. The truly beneficent principle is, however, identified as the Chrestos, not Christos. The Chrestos, the Good-One, is the designation of the beneficial solar entity. <br><br>Lucifer would also appear to have a central role in the origin of humanity, and in the origin of death. It is thought that Lucifer brought about physical procreation through a primeval sexual act with Cheva (Eve). With procreation came death; but of course without death there is no change, no evolution. Thus the opening of the gate of death, the act of &#x201c;sinking into matter,&#x201d; was a necessary step to link man to the current whereby Paradise can again he gained. But this time humanity will do it consciously and of its own will, and thus gain eternal life and wisdom. Then man will have truly become his own god--which is the path of Saturn.(51)<br><br>Also in accordance with its Gnostic heritage, the FS doctrines lay a strong emphasis on dualism. Not so much a good-versus-evil dualism, but rather a beyondgood-and-evil dualism summed up in the Saturn-Gnostic dictum <i>Lux e tenebris</i>--Light from the Darkness! In an article entitled &#x201c;Saturn-Yoga,&#x201d; Gregorius stated: &#x201c;Without Darkness there is no Light. The Light shines in the Darkness and the Darkness is more powerful than the Light!&#x201d;(52) This is an idea we have already met that simply states that the Light is held in a matrix of Darkness, that both are necessary to existence, and that it is the goal of the practitioner of Saturnian Gnosis to gain experience in, and mastery over, both the Light and the Darkness.</p><h2>King Lear: Ignatius Critical Editions</h2><p>One of the most popular of Shakespeare&#39;s plays, King Lear is also one of the most thought-provoking. The play turns on the practical ramifications of the words of Christ that we should render unto Caesar that which is Caesar&#39;s and unto God that which is God&#39;s. When confronted with the demand that she should render unto Caesar that which is God&#39;s, Cordelia chooses to love and be silent. As the play unfolds each of the principal characters learns wisdom through suffering.

Were the crusades the Christian equivalent of Muslim jihad? In this sweeping yet crisp history, Thomas F. Madden offers a brilliant and compelling narrative of the crusades and their contemporary relevance. Placing all of the major crusades within their medieval social, economic, religious, and intellectual environments, Madden explores the uniquely medieval world that led untold thousands to leave their homes, families, and friends to march in Christ&#x2019;s name to distant lands. From Palestine and Europe's farthest reaches, each crusade is recounted in a clear, concise narrative. The author gives special attention as well to the crusades&#x2019; effects on the Islamic world and the Christian Byzantine East.</p><p>Thomas F.

A widely recognized expert on the Crusades and Christian-Muslim relations, he is the author of numerous books, including The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople, Enrico Dandolo and the Rise of Venice, and Venice: A New History. Awards for his scholarship include the Haskins Medal (Medieval Academy of America) and the Otto Gr�ndler Prize (Medieval Institute). He resides in St. Louis, Missouri.Madden&#x2019;s clear text invites readers at all levels of knowledge into this commentary on how the crusades shaped our modern world. [He] convincingly shows how the crusades prove useful in understanding the political, cultural, and religious wars waged in today&#x2019;s society. True to the book&#x2019;s title, Madden manages to deftly discuss his research while maintaining a clear, approachable style that makes this text accessible to all levels of readers. . . . His ability to set the scene breathes life into the history. . . . The extent of Thomas Madden&#x2019;s research is evident, and his ability to describe history in an interesting and clear manner will appeal to all readers who enjoy reading about the past, especially where it is examined within a modern context. (<i>Foreword Reviews</i>)<br><br>Madden writes that the term and concept of the Crusades had been protean and exploited from the inception of the modern era. . . .For him, the historical understanding and popular perception of these campaigns have led to their condemnation. Yet he still defends them as an act of piety (i.e., bravery coupled with faith) and rejects the dominant perception that they are in any way responsible<br>for modern tensions between the Middle East and the West.

Pages are clean and binding is tight. Solid Book.</p><p>From 1946 to 1966, while serving the prison sentence handed down from the Nuremburg War Crimes tribunal, Albert Speer penned 1,200 manuscript pages of personal memoirs. Titled <i>Erinnerungen</i> ("Recollections") upon their 1969 publication in German, Speer's critically acclaimed personal history was translated into English and published one year later as <i>Inside the Third Reich</i>. Long after their initial publication, Speer's memoir continues to provide one of the most detailed and fascinating portrayals of life within Hitler's inner circles, the rise and fall of the third German empire, and of Hitler himself.<p> Speer chronicles his entire life, but the majority of <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> focuses on the years between 1933 and 1945, when Speer figured prominently in Hitler's government and the German war effort as Inspector General of Buildings for the Renovation of the Federal Capital and later as Minister of Arms and Munitions. Speer's recollections of both duties foreground the impossibility of reconciling Hitler's idealistic, imperialistic ambitions with both architectural and military reality. Throughout, <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> remains true to its author's intentions. With compelling insight, Speer reveals many of the "premises which almost inevitably led to the disasters" of the Third Reich as well as "what comes from one man's holding unrestricted power in his hands." <i>-- Bertina Loeffler</i></p>Albert Speer was Hitler&#39;s right hand man.

Hudson&#x2019;s most famous novel, Green Mansions is the book that sparked the nature conservation movement. The inspiration for the movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Green Mansions stunningly recreates the untouched forests of South America with amazing detail. After a failed revolution, Abel is forced to seek refuge in the virgin forests of southwestern Venezuela. There, in his &#x201c;green mansion&#x201d;, Abel meets the wood-nymph Rima, the last of a reclusive aboriginal race. The bird-girl&#x2019;s ethereal presence captivates him completely, but the love that blossoms is soon darkened by cruelty and sorrow. Exploring a love somewhere between reality and imagination, Green Mansions is a poignant meditation on the loss of wilderness, the dream of a return to nature and the bitter reality of the encounter between savage and civilized man.&nbsp; A master of natural history writing, W.H. Hudson forms a link between nineteenth-century Romanticism and the twentieth-century ecological movement. First published in 1904, Green Mansions owes much of its success to the mystic, near-religious feelings that pervade the story. Hudson&#x2019;s halting, poetic expressions combined with his descriptions of untouched, natural beauty makes Green Mansions as powerful call back to nature today as it was one hundred years ago.</p><p>William Henry Hudson (1841&#x2013;1922) was a writer, naturalist, and ornithologist.

Readers at all levels can continue to deepen their understanding of this rich tale about the Lover and his quest--against the admonishments of Reason and the obstacles set by Jealousy and Resistance--to pluck the fair Rose in the Enchanted Garden.</p><br><p> The original introduction by Dahlberg remains an excellent overview of the work, covering such topics as the iconographic significance of the imagery and the use of irony in developing the central theme of love. His new preface reviews selected scholarship through 1990, which examines, for example, the sources and influences of the work, the two authors, the nature of the allegorical narrative as a genre, the use of first person, and the poem's early reception. The new bibliographic material incorporates that of the earlier editions.

He knows he can revert to his own body by eating rose-petals, but these prove singularly elusive; and the bulk of the work describes his adventures as an animal. He also retails many stories that he overheard, the most charming being that of Cupid and Psyche (beginning, in true fairy-tale fashion, '<i>Erant in quadam civitate rex et regina</i>').

Angel-like Blengins with butterfly wings, natural catastrophes, innocent girls, and murderous soldiers all appear in Darger's scenes, which are reproduced in this book in double-page and gatefold illustrations. In the volume's introductory essay, Klaus Biesenbach examines the radical originality of Darger's art, including his use of collage, incorporation of religious themes and iconography, and frequent juxtaposition of innocence with violence. An essay by Brooke Davis Anderson illuminates Darger's source materials and techniques, while another by Michael Bonesteel puts Darger's life in the context of his work. The book also includes Darger's autobiography, "A History of My Life," introduced by Carl Watson. The only book of its kind, <i>Henry Darger</i> offers an authoritative, balanced, and insightful look at an American master.</p><p>KLAUS BIESENBACH is Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles."With scant but dense information about Darger's life and artistic contribution, the book allows viewers all the delight, awe, repulsion, sorrow, and wonder his oeuvre inevitably elicits."<br>&#x2014;<i>Rain Taxi</i></p><h2>Introductory And Intermediate Algebra For College Students</h2><p>Blitzer&#39;s mathematical rigor is combined with an engaging, friendly and often fun presentation for greater student appeal.

Bront�'s enigmatic heroine becomes the object of gossip and jealousy as neighbors learn she is escaping from an abusive marriage and living under an assumed name. A daring story that exposed the dark brutality of Victorian chauvinism, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was nevertheless attacked by some critics as a celebration of the same excesses it criticized.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every reader who has felt the power of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights comes, sooner or later, to The Tenant of Wildfell Hall," observed Bront� scholar Margaret Lane. "Anne Bront�, with all the Bront� taste for violence and drama, and with her experience of the same rude scenes and savage Yorkshire tales that had fed the imaginations of her sisters, did not shrink. She used the material at hand, and shaped it with singular honesty and seri-<br>ousness....Anne is a true Bront�." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This edition of The Tenant of Wildfell <br>Hall is the companion volume to the Mobil Masterpiece Theatre WGBH television presentation broadcast on PBS.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles.

The tale unfolds through a series of letters between two friends as one man learns more about Helen Huntingdon and the past that brought this young painter and single mother to Wildfell Hall. Powerfully plotted and unconventionally structured, <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> is now considered to be a classic of Victorian literature. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition includes a critical introduction that situates the novel in significant Victorian debates, and provides appendices that make clear Bront�&#x2019;s intellectual inheritance from important eighteenth-century writers such as Hannah More and Mary Wollstonecraft. Material on temperance, education, childrearing, and nineteenth-century women artists is also included in the appendices. </p></p><h2>La Nouvelle H�lo�se: Julie, or the New Eloise : Letters of Two Lovers, Inhabitants of a Small Town at the Foot of the Alps</h2><p><p>This landmark of the romantic movement not only greatly influenced the taste and morality of the eighteenth-century reading public but was also one of the most seminal and widely read literary works of its day. Seventy-two editions of the novel in French appeared between 1761 and 1800, and though Voltaire called its success one of the infamies of the century. It won for Rousseau a place beside the author of <em>Candide</em> as a director of European thought. The plot of the novel is one familiar to all literature; that of a fallen and regenerated woman. The first three parts are devoted to the celebration of the passionate, mutual love of Saint-Preux and Julie; the last three praise Julie's return to virtue as a faithful wife and dedicated mother. Professor McDowell's translation is precise but natural and conveys to the reader the distinctive flavor of Rousseau's style.</p></p><p><p>Judith McDowell is Professor of English at the University of Texas at Arlington.</p>&#x201c;McDowell's translation is literally faithful and direct but shows judicious idiomatic license in places where Rousseau's style or the requirements of the English phrase impose options, on the translator. . . . The average reader will thank McDowell for eliminating some of Rousseau's verbose, repetitive digressions. A perceptive introduction offers valuable insights on the novel's importance and Rousseau's style.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;<i>Choice</i></p></p><h2>Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction</h2><p><p>Now in its second edition, this bestselling textbook may be the single most influential study of the historical relationship between science and technology ever published. Tracing this relationship from the dawn of civilization through the twentieth century, James E. McClellan III and Harold Dorn argue that technology as "applied science" emerged relatively recently, as industry and governments began funding scientific research that would lead directly to new or improved technologies. </p><p>McClellan and Dorn identify two great scientific traditions: the useful sciences, patronized by the state from the dawn of civilization, and scientific theorizing, initiated by the ancient Greeks. They find that scientific traditions took root in China, India, and Central and South America, as well as in a series of Near Eastern empires, during late antiquity and the Middle Ages. From this comparative perspective, the authors explore the emergence of Europe and the United States as a scientific and technological power. </p><p>The new edition reorganizes its treatment of Greek science and significantly expands its coverage of industrial civilization and contemporary science and technology with new and revised chapters devoted to applied science, the sociology and economics of science, globalization, and the technological systems that underpin everyday life.</p></p><p><p>An integrated, perceptive, and highly readable account of the converging histories of science and technology.</p><p><b>James E.

From the point of view of a modern reader, brought up to regard the wresting of Magna Carta from King John as the most important event in his reign, Shakespeare&#39;s complete omission of any mention of this aspect of King John&#39;s struggle with the barons will also seem odd.</p><h2>Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar, 1983-1988 (Haynes Manuals)</h2><p>Haynes disassembles every subject vehicle and documents every step with thorough instructions and clear photos.

All that exists are phenomenal selves, as they appear in conscious experience. The phenomenal self, however, is not a thing but an ongoing process; it is the content of a "transparent self-model." In <i>Being No One</i>, Metzinger, a German philosopher, draws strongly on neuroscientific research to present a representationalist and functional analysis of what a consciously experienced first-person perspective actually is. Building a bridge between the humanities and the empirical sciences of the mind, he develops new conceptual toolkits and metaphors; uses case studies of unusual states of mind such as agnosia, neglect, blindsight, and hallucinations; and offers new sets of multilevel constraints for the concept of consciousness. Metzinger's central question is: How exactly does strong, consciously experienced subjectivity emerge out of objective events in the natural world? His epistemic goal is to determine whether conscious experience, in particular the experience of being someone that results from the emergence of a phenomenal self, can be analyzed on subpersonal levels of description. He also asks if and how our Cartesian intuitions that subjective experiences as such can never be reductively explained are themselves ultimately rooted in the deeper representational structure of our conscious minds.</p></p><p>Thomas Metzinger is Professor of Philosophy and Fellow at the Gutenberg Research College at the Johannes Gutenberg-Universit�t, Mainz, and an Adjunct Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Study in Frankfurt am Main. He is the editor of <i>Neural Correlates of Consciousness </i>and the author of <i>Being No One</i>, both published by the MIT Press.<p><i>Being No One</i> is Kantian in its scope, intelligence and depth. Steeped in contemporary neuroscience, psychology and philosophy, the book gives the unsolved Kantian problems of inner self and outer world a new look, a new life, and a new route to solution.

Inspired by their years catering parties, chefs Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski use dim sum style carts to offer guests small but finely crafted dishes ranging from Potato Chips with Cre&#x300;me Fraiche and Cured Trout Roe, to Black Butter-Balsamic Figs with Wagon Wheel Cheese Fondue, to their famous savory pancakes (such as Chanterelle Pancakes with Lardo and Maple Vinegar), along with a menu of more substantial dishes such as their signature fried quail with stewed onions. <br><br>Their singular and original approach to cooking, which expertly blends seemingly disparate influences, flavors, and textures, is a style that has influenced other restaurants throughout the country and is beloved by diners, chefs, and critics alike. In the debut cookbook from this acclaimed restaurant, Brioza and Krasinski share recipes for their most popular dishes along with stunning photography, and inspire readers to craft an unforgettable meal of textures, temperatures, aromas, and colors that excite all of the senses.</p><p>STUART BRIOZA and NICOLE KRASINSKI are the chef/owners of State Bird Provisions and The Progress in San Francisco. JJ GOODE is a Brooklyn-based food writer and the coauthor of the books <i>A Girl and Her Pig </i>with April Bloomfield, Morimoto with Masaharu Morimoto, <i>Truly Mexican </i>with Roberto Santibanez, and <i>Pok Pok </i>with Andy Ricker.INTRODUCTION&nbsp;<br><br>When we opened State Bird Provisions, there was no menu. Every single dish came around on carts (fashioned for us by a woodworker friend in Seattle). Nicole and I high-fived because we had figured out how to skip writing menus, a task few chefs like. All we had to do was put food on the plate and wait for people to go nuts for it. Let&#x2019;s just say it didn&#x2019;t quite work out that way.&nbsp;<br><br>At the time, State Bird was even smaller than it is today. Servers barely had room to squeeze their bodies between tables, let alone navigate carts through a maze of chairs, feet, and elbows. Space was so tight near the door, where we had a small bar for people willing to stand, that both carts and diners occasionally had to pass through the open kitchen up front. Cooking during service often feels like a battle. Cooking at State Bird felt like skydiving&#x2014;we were always teetering between exhilaration and disaster.&nbsp;<br><br>To make matters worse, not even lovers of dim sum knew what to make of the carts when dumplings and egg custard tarts were replaced by miniature Dutch ovens filled with pork belly, clam, and kimchi stew; squid stuffed with carnitas; and shot glasses of peanut milk. Customers eagerly quizzed servers about the dishes. &#x201c;Are those the beets?&#x201d; they&#x2019;d ask, pointing to wedges that we&#x2019;d crusted in rye and set on horseradish-and-ale cream. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s in that sauce?&#x201d; they&#x2019;d wonder, ogling a plate of grilled bitter greens served with yogurt mixed with smoky Urfa chiles. The typical service interaction had become a conversation. It was awesome. There was just one problem: Customers would frequently let the carts roll away without partaking. They were sensibly waiting to see what their options were before they made decisions&#x2014;as food got cold and desserts melted. In other words, they wanted a menu.<br><br>In fact, &#x201c;Can I please have a menu?&#x201d; was the number-one request. So for three days, we handed out menus. And it was the worst. That rapport between servers and diners evaporated. The carts suddenly seemed like an unnecessary, unwieldy novelty. And people tried less food. For weeks, after each service, I&#x2019;d stay up way too late rethinking the restaurant&#x2019;s format. Every morning I woke up with some new solution. Inching closer to what State Bird was meant to be.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;� � � � �&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;Finally, after a month, we found a lasting compromise. Diners could order a small selection of dishes from a menu. The rest of the food remained on the carts, tempting people as it rolled by. Most important, we accepted our strange idea as something we loved and wouldn&#x2019;t ever abandon. So what if it took a bit (okay, a lot) of explaining? So what if it wasn&#x2019;t practical or efficient or sensible? We had seen the spirit those carts fostered in the dining room, the fun everyone was having&#x2014;from the diners to the servers to the cooks.&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;Today, when we look at photos of the early days, we cringe, because we see all the restaurant&#x2019;s faults. The sad, empty walls. The scruffy floor. The fluorescent lights, which were supposed to create a funky diner feel but created a too-bright dining room instead. We see a space hurried into the world. But we also remember the life the place had then and still has, the vitality that comes from letting your gut guide you, then figuring things out as they come. Long ago, Stuart and I both thought about becoming photographers&#x2014;we basically fell in love in the darkroom at De Anza College in Cupertino. After taking many poor photographs, I learned that my carefully calculated shots never turned out as beautifully as those I took on a whim, when something caught my eye and I just clicked the shutter.&nbsp;<br><br> � � � � �&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Thinking back on it, of course, we&#x2019;re glad we didn&#x2019;t have the luxury to overthink or decide to go a more conventional route. But at the time, doubts were eating at us. I&#x2019;d be in the open kitchen, brushing slow-cooked pork ribs with a glaze made from their own juices or pouring sauerkraut broth over duck neck dumplings, when a diner seated across the counter would ask me to explain our unusual ways&#x2014;just as the diner before him had. Every time they&#x2019;d ask, I&#x2019;d get about halfway through my convoluted answer before I started to wonder what the heck we&#x2019;d gotten ourselves into. I&#x2019;d have an existential crisis in the middle of service.<br><br>Eight months in, everything changed. Well, everything and nothing at all. <i>Bon App�tit </i>magazine named State Bird the best new restaurant in the country. Within four hours of the announcement, every reservable seat at the restaurant was booked. And before we opened that day, a line of people willing to wait hours for our walk-in spots stretched down Fillmore Street. That line has been there practically every evening since. Later, our online reservation system was hacked, crafty coders nabbing tables seconds after they became available&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what you get when you&#x2019;re an hour&#x2019;s drive from Silicon Valley. The queue outside generated a mini economy. Through the site TaskRabbit, people hired surrogates to stand in line in order to score a table without waiting themselves. We were so grateful that we started bringing out hot cocoa on chilly nights. Anyone willing to participate in our social experiment deserved a treat.&nbsp;<br><br>Such good press was a tremendous gift. And it did something so much more important than just fill up the restaurant. Suddenly, instead of having to explain who we were, we had customers coming precisely <i>because </i>of who we were. It took away those doubts&#x2014;or at least most of them. Any lingering worries no longer mattered&#x2014;we couldn&#x2019;t turn back anyway. That liberated us. Instead of lying in bed concocting new fixes, I&#x2019;d wake up every morning thinking, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in love with this restaurant.&#x201d;</p><h2>Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized System</h2><p>Paul Goodman (9/9/11-8/2/72) was an American sociologist, poet, writer, anarchist, public intellectual &amp; gay-rights activist. He's now mainly remembered as the author of Growing Up Absurd &amp; as an activist on the pacifist Left in the '60s &amp; an inspiration to that era's student movement. He's less remembered as a cofounder of Gestalt Therapy in the '40s &amp; '50s. In the mid-40s, together with C. Wright Mills, he contributed to Politics, a journal edited then by Dwight Macdonald. In '47, he published Kafka's Prayer &amp; Communitas, a classic study of urban design coauthored with his brother Percival. Fame came only with the '60 publication of his Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized System. He also knew &amp; worked with other leading NY intellectuals, including Daniel Bell, Norman Mailer, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Norman Podhoretz, Mary McCarthy, Lionel Trilling &amp; Philip Rahv. His writings also appeared in Partisan Review, The New Republic, Commentary, The New Leader, Dissent &amp; NY Review of Books. Growing Up Absurd analyses the causes &amp; effects of: "the disgrace of the Organised System, of semimonopolies, government, advertisers etc. &amp; the disaffection of the growing generation". Goodman asserts that the young really need a more worthwhile world in order to grow up at all, confronting this real need with the world that they've been getting.</p><p></p><h2>The Koehler Method of Open Obedience for Ring, Home and Field,</h2><p>Describes methods for increasing the learning capacity and emotional stability of a dog so that it can perform useful tasks</p><p></p><h2>Treason in the Blood: H. St. John Philby, Kim Philby, and the Spy Case of the Century</h2><p>A dual biography of Kim Philby, the most remarkable double agent in recent history, and his mentor-father, an intellectual and adventurer who shaped his son&#39;s destiny</p><p>Anthony Cave Brown is the author of Treason in the Blood, On a feild of Red, Bodyguard of Lies, and biographies of Stewart Menzies and William S. Dinivan. He currently lives in Broad Run, Virgina.The tale has been told many times, the theories get ever more intricate, but Canute himself could not still the waves of interest in British spy Kim Philby and what author Brown (Bodyguard of Lies, 1975) calls with some justice ``the spy case of the century.'' This book's new wrinkle is that it's a dual biography of Kim and his father, the formidable H. St. John Philby, who was not only a great Arabist and traveler (he crossed Arabia's fearful Empty Quarter), but was almost as puzzling a figure as his son. This one- time employee of the Raj was also an atheist, an anti-imperialist, and a socialist; interned for sympathizing with the Nazis during WW II, he became a communist at the end of his life. Clearly an ornery customer, but, though Brown quotes a KGB spokesman in 1991 calling St. John a ``Soviet asset,'' it is hard to conclude that he was a traitor, and he would certainly have denied it hotly. By contrast, Brown goes fully into the dispute that rages as to where the son's ultimate loyalties lay; in terms of the results--agents captured, missions gone wrong, secrets apparently lost, his ultimate 25-year stay in Moscow--it is hard to conclude that Kim was anything other than the servant of Communism that he claimed to be, a spy so successful that he penetrated to the highest reaches of the British Secret Service and, in Brown's view, made mincemeat out of the CIA into the bargain.

They are, perhaps, the most frequently produced works on the planet.Since we will never hear tapes of Keats or Shakespeare reading, and several recordings by actors exist (e.g., John Keats: Selected Poems, Blackstone Audio, 1993; Sonnets by William Shakespeare, Recorded Bks., 1990), we must judge these tapes by the actors' performances. In John Keats: Poems, Douglas Dodge modulates his voice beautifully to capture the slightly varied emotions of many poems. This well-edited recording contains Keats's most famous works: "La Belle Dame Sans Merci," "The Eve of St. Agnes," "Ode to a Nightingale," "On a Grecian Urn," along with many lesser-known short poems such as "To Mrs. Reynolds' Cat" that exhibit the poet's more fanciful side. Reading all of Shakespeare's sonnets written between 1593 and 1601, actor Simon Callow conveys the dramatic potential not often recognizable in other recordings. With the exception of a few sonnets addressing the muse, anyone unfamiliar with Shakespeare's works could easily believe these were selected monologs from various plays. Pausing briefly between poems, Callow's tone shifts enough to create new characterizations for every sonnet.

And they left behind magnificent monuments &#x2013;&#x2013; baffling monoliths and awesome, towering structures that stand to this day as testaments to their greatness. </p> <p> In this extraordinarily documented, meticulously researched work, Zecharia Sitchin draws remarkable correlations between the events that shape our civilisation in millennia past &#x2013; pinpointing with astonishing accuracy the tumultuous beginning of time as we know it . . . and revealing to us the indisputable signature of extraterrestrial god indelibly written in stone.</p>Dear Reader, <br> <br> <em>The Earth Chronicles</em> series is based on the premise that mythology is the depository of ancient recollections, that the Bible should be read literally as a historic-scientific document, and that ancient civilizations were the product of knowledge brought to Earth by the Anunnaki--&#x201c;Those who from Heaven to Earth came.&#x201d; <br> <br>Complementing each other and serving to bring the saga of gods and humans on Earth ever closer to our time, each book of the series looks at this awesome tale from a different perspective. <br> <br> <em>The 12th Planet</em>, the first book of the series, brings to life the Sumerian civilization and presents millennia-old evidence of the existence of Nibiru, the home planet of the Anunnaki, and the landings of the Anunnaki on Earth every 3,600 years. <br> <br> <em>The Stairway to Heaven</em>, the second book, incorporates ancient Egyptian evidence to show that the gateway between the mortal and the divine was a spaceport in the Sinai Peninsula, with the Giza pyramids and the Sphinx serving as beacons for the landings. <br> <br> <em>The Wars of Gods and Men</em>, the third book, additionally embraces Canaanite, Hittite, and Hindu sources to include in these investigations the incidents of the Tower of Babel and the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah, concluding that nuclear weapons were used on Earth 4,000 years ago. <br> <br> <em>The Lost Realms</em>, the fourth book, transports readers to the pre-Columbian civilizations and ancient empires of the Americas, revealing hitherto unrecognized golden links between ancient Near Eastern civilizations and the "cities of the gods" of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs, and Incas. <br> <br> <em>When Time Began</em>, the fifth book, explores ancient knowledge of Heaven and Earth and the interwoven cycles that gave rise to astronomy, the zodiac and astrology, and stone calendars such as Stonehenge, revealing the secret of New Ages past and future. <br> <br>And <em>The Cosmic Code</em>, the sixth book in the series, explains how the secrets of humankind&#x2019;s celestial teachers were encoded in the Bible and other sacred and hidden &#x201c;books&#x201d;--a cosmic code that links Earthlings to their cosmic roots. <br> <br>In the years since each book was published, new scientific discoveries have provided mounting corroboration of the series&#x2019; incredible and unorthodox science-based conclusions. This accumulation of discoveries and the origins of humankind and the solar system are further discussed in the companion books <em>Genesis Revisited</em> and <em>Divine Encounters</em>. I trust that modern science will continue to confirm ancient knowledge. <br> <br>Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) was born in Russia and grew up in Palestine, where he acquired a profound knowledge of modern and ancient Hebrew, other Semitic and European languages, the Old Testament, and the history and archaeology of the Near East. A graduate of the University of London with a degree in economic history, he worked as a journalist and editor for many years prior to undertaking his life&#x2019;s work-- <em>The Earth Chronicles</em>. <br> <br>One of the few scholars able to read the clay tablets and interpret ancient Sumerian and Akkadian, Sitchin based <em>The Earth Chronicles</em> series on the texts and pictorial evidence recorded by the ancient civilizations of the Near East.

This textbook provides a lucid and integrative analysis of the central topics in pragmatics - deixis, implicature, presupposition, speech acts, and conversational structure. A central concern of the book is the relation between pragmatics and semantics, and Dr Levinson shows clearly how a pragmatic approach can resolve some of the problems semantics have been confronting and simplifying semantic analyses. The exposition is always clear and supported by helpful exemplification. The detailed analyses of selected topics give the student a clear view of the empirical rigour demanded by the study of linguistic pragmatics, but Dr Levinson never loses sight of the rich diversity of the subject. An introduction and conclusion relate pragmatics to other fields in linguistics and other disciplines concerned with language usage - psychology, philosophy, anthropology and literature.</p><p>An integrative and lucid analysis of central topics in the field of linguistic pragmatics deixis, implicature, presupposition, speed acts, and conversational structure.</p><h2>The Enchanted April (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The charming, slyly comic novel of romantic longing and transformation that inspired the Oscar-nominated film</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Four very different women, looking to escape dreary London for the sunshine of Italy, take up an offer advertised in the<i> Times</i> for a &#x201c;small medieval Italian Castle on the shores of the Mediterranean to be let furnished for the month of April.&#x201d; As each blossoms in the warmth of the Italian spring, quite unexpected changes occur.<br><br>An immediate bestseller upon its first publication, in 1922, <i>The Enchanted April</i> set off a craze for tourism to the Italian Riviera that continues today.

Yet the advertisement had been addressed to persons who appreciate these things, so that it had been, anyhow, addressed too to her, for she certainly appreciated them; more than anybody knew; more than she had ever told. But she was poor. In the whole world she possessed of her own only ninety pounds, saved from year to year, put by carefully pound by pound, out of her dress allowance. She had scraped this sum together at the suggestion of her husband as a shield and refuge against a rainy day. Her dress allowance, given her by her father, was �100 a year, so that Mrs Wilkins&#x2019;s clothes were what her husband, urging her to save, called modest and becoming and her acquaintance to each other, when they spoke of her at all, which was seldom for she was very negligible, called a perfect sight.</p><p>Mr Wilkins, a solicitor, encouraged thrift, except that branch of it which got into his food. He did not call that thrift, he called it bad housekeeping. But for the thrift which, like moth, penetrated into Mrs Wilkins&#x2019;s clothes and spoilt them, he had much praise. &#x2018;You never know,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;when there will be a rainy day, and you may be very glad to find you have a nest-egg. Indeed we both may.&#x2019;</p><p>Looking out of the club window into Shaftesbury Avenue&nbsp;&#x2013; hers was an economical club, but convenient for Hampstead, where she lived, and for Shoolbred&#x2019;s where she shopped&nbsp;&#x2013; Mrs Wilkins, having stood there some time very drearily, her mind&#x2019;s eye on the Mediterranean in April, and the wistaria, and the enviable opportunities of the rich, while her bodily eye watched the really extremely horrible sooty rain falling steadily on the hurrying umbrellas and splashing omnibuses, suddenly wondered whether perhaps this was not the rainy day Mellersh&nbsp;&#x2013; Mellersh was Mr Wilkins&nbsp;&#x2013; had so often encouraged her to prepare for, and whether to get out of such a climate and into the small mediaeval castle wasn&#x2019;t perhaps what Providence had all along intended her to do with her savings. Part of her savings, of course; perhaps quite a small part. The castle, being mediaeval, might also be dilapidated, and dilapidations were surely cheap. She wouldn&#x2019;t in the least mind a few of them, because you didn&#x2019;t pay for dilapidations which were already there; on the contrary&nbsp;&#x2013; by reducing the price you had to pay they really paid you. But what nonsense to think of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>She turned away from the window with the same gesture of mingled irritation and resignation with which she had laid down The Times, and crossed the room towards the door with the intention of getting her mackintosh and umbrella and fighting her way into one of the overcrowded omnibuses and going to Shoolbred&#x2019;s on her way home and buying some soles for Mellersh&#x2019;s dinner&nbsp;&#x2013; Mellersh was difficult with fish and liked only soles, except salmon&nbsp;&#x2013; when she beheld Mrs Arbuthnot, a woman she knew by sight as also living in Hampstead and belonging to the club, sitting at the table in the middle of the room on which the newspapers and magazines were kept, absorbed, in her turn, in the first page of The Times.</p><p>Mrs Wilkins had never yet spoken to Mrs Arbuthnot, who belonged to one of the various church sets, and who analysed, classified, divided and registered the poor; whereas she and Mellersh, when they did go out, went to the parties of impressionist painters, of whom in Hampstead there were many. Mellersh had a sister who had married one of them and lived up on the Heath, and because of this alliance Mrs Wilkins was drawn into a circle which was highly unnatural to her, and she had learned to dread pictures. She had to say things about them, and she didn&#x2019;t know what to say. She used to murmur, &#x2018;Marvellous,&#x2019; and feel that it was not enough. But nobody minded. Nobody listened. Nobody took any notice of Mrs Wilkins. She was the kind of person who is not noticed at parties. Her clothes, infested by thrift, made her practically invisible; her face was non-arresting; her conversation was reluctant; she was shy. And if one&#x2019;s clothes and face and conversation are all negligible, thought Mrs Wilkins, who recognized her disabilities, what, at parties, is there left of one?</p><p>Also she was always with Wilkins, that clean-shaven, fine-looking man, who gave a party, merely by coming to it, a great air. Wilkins was very respectable. He was known to be highly thought of by his senior partners. His sister&#x2019;s circle admired him. He pronounced adequately intelligent judgments on art and artists. He was pithy; he was prudent; he never said a word too much, nor, on the other hand, did he ever say a word too little. He produced the impression of keeping copies of everything he said; and he was so obviously reliable that it often happened that people who met him at these parties became discontented with their own solicitors, and after a period of restlessness extricated themselves and went to Wilkins.</p><p>Naturally Mrs Wilkins was blotted out. &#x2018;She,&#x2019; said his sister, with something herself of the judicial, the digested, and the final in her manner, &#x2018;should stay at home.&#x2019; But Wilkins could not leave his wife at home. He was a family solicitor, and all such have wives and show them. With his in the week he went to parties, and with his on Sundays he went to church. Being still fairly young&nbsp;&#x2013; he was thirty-nine&nbsp;&#x2013; and ambitious of old ladies, of whom he had not yet acquired in his practice a sufficient number, he could not afford to miss church, and it was there that Mrs Wilkins became familiar, though never through words, with Mrs Arbuthnot.</p><p>She saw her marshalling the children of the poor into pews. She would come in at the head of the procession from the Sunday School exactly five minutes before the choir, and get her boys and girls neatly fitted into their allotted seats, and down on their little knees in their preliminary prayer, and up again on their feet just as, to the swelling organ, the vestry door opened, and the choir and clergy, big with the litanies and commandments they were presently to roll out, emerged. She had a sad face, yet she was evidently efficient. The combination used to make Mrs Wilkins wonder, for she had been told by Mellersh, on days when she had only been able to get plaice, that if one were efficient one wouldn&#x2019;t be depressed, and that if one does one&#x2019;s job well one becomes automatically bright and brisk.</p><p>About Mrs Arbuthnot there was nothing bright and brisk, though much in her way with the Sunday School children that was automatic; but when Mrs Wilkins, turning from the window, caught sight of her in the club she was not being automatic at all, but was looking fixedly at one portion of the first page of The Times, holding the paper quite still, her eyes not moving. She was just staring; and her face, as usual, was the face of a patient and disappointed Madonna.</p><p>Obeying an impulse she wondered at even while obeying it, Mrs Wilkins, the shy and the reluctant, instead of proceeding as she had intended to the cloakroom and from thence to Shoolbred&#x2019;s in search of Mellersh&#x2019;s fish, stopped at the table and sat down exactly opposite Mrs Arbuthnot, to whom she had never yet spoken in her life.</p><p>It was one of those long, narrow refectory tables, so that they were quite close to each other.</p><p>Mrs Arbuthnot, however, did not look up. She continued to gaze, with eyes that seemed to be dreaming, at one spot only of The Times.</p><p>Mrs Wilkins watched her a minute, trying to screw up courage to speak to her. She wanted to ask her if she had seen the advertisement. She did not know why she wanted to ask her this, but she wanted to. How stupid not to be able to speak to her. She looked so kind. She looked so unhappy. Why couldn&#x2019;t two unhappy people refresh each other on their way through this dusty business of life by a little talk&nbsp;&#x2013; real, natural talk, about what they felt, what they would have liked, what they still tried to hope? And she could not help thinking that Mrs Arbuthnot, too, was reading that very same advertisement. Her eyes were on the very part of the paper. Was she, too, picturing what it would be like&nbsp;&#x2013; the colour, the fragrance, the light, the soft lapping of the sea among little hot rocks? Colour, fragrance, light, sea; instead of Shaftesbury Avenue, and the wet omnibuses, and the fish department at Shoolbred&#x2019;s, and the Tube to Hampstead, and dinner, and tomorrow the same and the day after the same and always the same&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Suddenly Mrs Wilkins found herself leaning across the table. &#x2018;Are you reading about the mediaeval castle and the wistaria?&#x2019; she heard herself asking.</p><p>Naturally Mrs Arbuthnot was surprised; but she was not half so much surprised as Mrs Wilkins was at herself for asking.</p><p>Mrs Arbuthnot had not yet to her knowledge set eyes on the shabby, lank, loosely-put-together figure sitting opposite her, with its small freckled face and big grey eyes almost disappearing under a smashed-down wet-weather hat, and she gazed at her a moment without answering. She was reading about the mediaeval castle and the wistaria, or rather had read about it ten minutes before, and since then had been lost in dreams&nbsp;&#x2013; of light, of colour, of fragrance, of the soft lapping of the sea among little hot rocks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x2018;Why do you ask me that?&#x2019; she said in her grave voice, for her training of and by the poor had made her grave and patient.</p><p>Mrs Wilkins flushed and looked excessively shy and frightened. &#x2018;Oh, only because I saw it too, and I thought perhaps&nbsp;&#x2013; I thought somehow&#x2014;&#x2019; she stammered.</p><p>Whereupon Mrs Arbuthnot, her mind being used to getting people into lists and divisions, from habit considered, as she gazed thoughtfully at Mrs Wilkins, under what heading, supposing she had to classify her, she could most properly be put.</p><p>&#x2018;And I know you by sight,&#x2019; went on Mrs Wilkins, who, like all the shy, once she was started plunged on, frightening herself to more and more speech by the sheer sound of what she had said last in her ears. &#x2018;Every Sunday&nbsp;&#x2013; I see you every Sunday in church&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;In church?&#x2019; echoed Mrs Arbuthnot.</p><p>&#x2018;And this seems such a wonderful thing&nbsp;&#x2013; this advertisement about the wistaria&nbsp;&#x2013; and&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>Mrs Wilkins, who must have been at least thirty, broke off and wriggled in her chair with the movement of an awkward and embarrassed schoolgirl.</p><p>&#x2018;It seems so wonderful,&#x2019; she went on in a kind of burst, &#x2018;and&nbsp;&#x2013; it is such a miserable day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;</p><p>And then she sat looking at Mrs Arbuthnot with the eyes of an imprisoned dog.</p><p>&#x2018;This poor thing,&#x2019; thought Mrs Arbuthnot, whose life was spent in helping and alleviating, &#x2018;needs advice.&#x2019;</p><p>She accordingly prepared herself patiently to give it.</p><p>&#x2018;If you see me in church,&#x2019; she said, kindly and attentively, &#x2018;I suppose you live in Hampstead too?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh yes,&#x2019; said Mrs Wilkins. And she repeated, her head on its long thin neck drooping a little as if the recollection of Hampstead bowed her, &#x2018;Oh yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Where?&#x2019; asked Mrs Arbuthnot, who, when advice was needed, naturally first proceeded to collect the facts.</p><p>But Mrs Wilkins, laying her hand softly and caressingly on the part of The Times where the advertisement was, as though the mere printed words of it were precious, only said, &#x2018;Perhaps that&#x2019;s why this seems so wonderful.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No&nbsp;&#x2013; I think that&#x2019;s wonderful anyhow,&#x2019; said Mrs Arbuthnot, forgetting facts and faintly sighing.</p><p>&#x2018;Then you were reading it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; said Mrs Arbuthnot, her eyes going dreamy again.</p><p>&#x2018;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be wonderful?&#x2019; murmured Mrs Wilkins.</p><p>&#x2018;Wonderful,&#x2019; said Mrs Arbuthnot. Her face, which had lit up, faded into patience again. &#x2018;Very wonderful,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;But it&#x2019;s no use wasting one&#x2019;s time thinking of such things.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, but it is,&#x2019; was Mrs Wilkins&#x2019;s quick, surprising reply; surprising because it was so much unlike the rest of her&nbsp;&#x2013; the characterless coat and skirt, the crumpled hat, the undecided wisp of hair straggling out. &#x2018;And just the considering of them is worth while in itself&nbsp;&#x2013; such a change from Hampstead&nbsp;&#x2013; and sometimes I believe&nbsp;&#x2013; I really do believe&nbsp;&#x2013; if one considers hard enough one gets things.&#x2019;</p><p>Mrs Arbuthnot observed her patiently. In what category would she, supposing she had to, put her?</p><p>&#x2018;Perhaps,&#x2019; she said, leaning forward a little, &#x2018;you will tell me your name. If we are to be friends&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2013; she smiled her grave smile&nbsp;&#x2013; &#x2018;as I hope we are, we had better begin at the beginning.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh yes&nbsp;&#x2013; how kind of you. I&#x2019;m Mrs Wilkins,&#x2019; said Mrs Wilkins. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t expect,&#x2019; she added, flushing, as Mrs Arbuthnot said nothing, &#x2018;that it conveys anything to you. Sometimes it&nbsp;&#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t seem to convey anything to me either. But&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2013; she looked round with a movement of seeking help&nbsp;&#x2013; &#x2018;I am Mrs Wilkins.&#x2019;</p><p>She did not like her name. It was a mean, small name, with a kind of facetious twist, she thought, about its end like the upward curve of a pugdog&#x2019;s tail. There it was, however. There was no doing anything with it. Wilkins she was and Wilkins she would remain; and though her husband encouraged her to give it on all occasions as Mrs Mellersh-Wilkins she only did that when he was within earshot, for she thought Mellersh made Wilkins worse, emphasizing it in the way Chatsworth on the gateposts of a villa emphasizes the villa.</p><p>When first he suggested she should add Mellersh she had objected for the above reason, and after a pause&nbsp;&#x2013; Mellersh was much too prudent to speak except after a pause, during which presumably he was taking a careful mental copy of his coming observation&nbsp;&#x2013; he said, much displeased, &#x2018;But I am not a villa,&#x2019; and looked at her as he looks who hopes, for perhaps the hundredth time, that he may not have married a fool.</p><p>Of course he was not a villa, Mrs Wilkins assured him; she had never supposed he was; she had not dreamed of meaning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she was only just thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>The more she explained the more earnest became Mellersh&#x2019;s hope, familiar to him by this time, for he had then been a husband for two years, that he might not by any chance have married a fool; a...</p></p><h2>Trauma-Sensitive Yoga in Therapy: Bringing the Body into Treatment</h2><p><p><strong>This practical guide presents the cutting-edge work of the Trauma Center&#x2019;s yoga therapy program, teaching all therapists how to incorporate it into their practices.</strong></p> When treating a client who has suffered from interpersonal trauma&#x2015;whether chronic childhood abuse or domestic violence, for example&#x2015;talk therapy isn&#x2019;t always the most effective course. For these individuals, the trauma and its effects are so entrenched, so complex, that reducing their experience to a set of symptoms or suggesting a change in cognitive frame or behavioral pattern ignores a very basic but critical player: the body.<br><br> In cases of complex trauma, mental health professionals largely agree that the body itself contains and manifests much of the suffering&#x2015;self hatred, shame, and fear. Take, for example, a woman who experienced years of childhood sexual abuse and, though very successful in her professional life, has periods of not being able to feel her limbs, sensing an overall disconnection from her very physical being. Reorienting clients to their bodies and building their &#x201c;body sense&#x201d; can be the very key to unlocking their pain and building a path toward healing.<br><br> Based on research studies conducted at the renowned Trauma Center in Brookline, Massachusetts, this book presents the successful intervention known as Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TSY), an evidence-based program for traumatized clients that helps them to reconnect to their bodies in a safe, deliberate way.<br><br> Synthesized here and presented in a concise, reader-friendly format, all clinicians, regardless of their background or familiarity with yoga, can understand and use these simple techniques as a way to help their clients achieve deeper, more lasting recovery.<br><br> Unlike traditional, mat-based yoga, TSY can be practiced without one, in a therapist&#x2019;s chair or on a couch. Emphasis is always placed on the internal experience of the client him- or herself, not on achieving the proper form or pleasing the therapist. As Emerson carefully explains, the therapist guides the client to become accustomed to feeling something in the body&#x2015;feet on the ground or a muscle contracting&#x2015;in the present moment, choosing what to do about it in real time, and taking effective action. In this way, everything about the practice is optional, safe, and gentle, geared to helping clients to befriend their bodies.<br><br> With over 30 photographs depicting the suggested yoga forms and a final chapter that presents a portfolio of step-by-step yoga practices to use with your clients, this practical book makes yoga therapy for trauma survivors accessible to all clinicians. As an adjunct to your current treatment approach or a much-needed tool to break through to your traumatized clients, <em>Trauma-Sensitive Yoga in Therapy</em> will empower you and your clients on the path to healing. 38 illustrations</p><p>David Emerson, an accomplished yoga instructor, lecturer, and trainer, is founder of the Black Lotus Yoga Project, Inc., a nonprofit dedicated to teaching yoga to individuals with PTSD. He is also coordinator of the yoga services program at The Trauma Center of the Justice Resource Institute in Brookline, Massachusetts, and serves as the lead trainer in a number of yoga retreats and workshops at Kripalu, among other venues&#x201c;This is not a book of anecdotes, but a book that describes a method and how it has been shown to help a wide range of clients with trauma. Emerson&#x2019;s passion is evident on every page, but he is forthcoming about the potential limitations of TSY: It is not a cure, nor is it a temporary remedy for an otherwise long-term condition. Instead, TSY is to be used in tandem with traditional therapy. And it is a tool for coping that I, for one, think is worth considering.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>PsychCentral</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This user-friendly, easily read book provides ample case vignettes, suggested language and photo images of yoga forms to use.

Wealthy American John Dowell tells what he calls "the saddest story," about a secret affair between his wife and another man that is finally revealed in a crescendo of death and madness. Ford's novel reflects contemporary interests in psychology, sexuality, and the New Woman, and it treats Henry James's "transatlantic theme" with an existential horror comparable to Joseph Conrad's. Its portrayal of the destruction of a civilized elite anticipates the cataclysm of the First World War, which erupted while Ford was finishing the book. <br><br>This new edition features an Introduction by Max Saunders, one of the leading Ford scholars, who explores the novel as a key work of Modernism, shedding light on the nature of literary Impressionism and its relationship with the psychological realism of the characters. An appendix includes Ford's crucial essay "On Impressionism," written contemporaneously with the novel, which offers insight into Ford's artistry. This edition also has extensive notes, a chronology of the novel's main events, and an up-to-date bibliography.<br><br><strong>About the Series</strong>: For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>First published in 1915, Ford Madox Ford's <i>The Good Soldier</i> begins, famously and ominously, "This is the saddest story I have ever heard." The book then proceeds to confute this pronouncement at every turn, exposing a world less sad than pathetic, and more shot through with hypocrisy and deceit than its incredulous narrator, John Dowell, cares to imagine. Somewhat forgotten as a classic, <i>The Good Soldier</i> has been called everything from the consummate novelist's novel to one of the greatest English works of the century. And although its narrative hook--the philandering of an otherwise noble man--no longer shocks, its unerring cadences and doleful inevitabilities proclaim an enduring appeal.<p> Ford's novel revolves around two couples: Edward Ashburnham--the title's soldier--and his capable if off-putting wife, Leonora; and long-transplanted Americans John and Florence Dowell. The foursome's ostensible amiability, on display as they pass parts of a dozen pre-World War I summers together in Germany, conceals the fissures in each marriage. John is miserably mismatched with the garrulous, cuckolding Florence; and Edward, dashing and sentimental, can't refrain from falling in love with women whose charms exceed Leonora's. Predictably, Edward and Florence conduct their affair, an indiscretion only John seems not to notice. After the deaths of the two lovers, and after Leonora explains much of the truth to John, he recounts the events of their four lives with an extended inflection of outrage. From his retrospective perch, his recollections simmer with a bitter skepticism even as he expresses amazement at how much he overlooked.</p><p> Dowell's resigned narration is flawlessly conversational--haphazard, sprawling, lusting for sympathy. He exudes self-preservation even as he alternately condemns and lionizes Edward: "If I had had the courage and the virility and possibly also the physique of Edward Ashburnham I should, I fancy, have done much what he did." Stunningly, Edward's adultery comes to seem not merely excusable, but almost sublime. "Perhaps he could not bear to see a woman and not give her the comfort of his physical attractions," John surmises. Ford's novel deserves its reputation if for no other reason than the elegance with which it divulges hidden lives. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Ford Madox Ford wrote The Good Soldier, the book on which his reputation most surely rests, in deliberate emulation of the nineteenth-century French novels he so admired. In this way he was able to explore the theme of sexual betrayal and its poisonous after-effects with a psychological intimacy as yet unknown in the English novel.</p><h2>Theories of Psychotherapy &amp; Counseling: Concepts and Cases, 5th Edition</h2><p>Comprehensive in scope yet succinct in its descriptions and explanations, THEORIES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY &amp; COUNSELING: CONCEPTS AND CASES, 5e equips readers with a solid understanding of the systematic theories of psychotherapy and counseling.

Commercial art and architecture seem more revealing of their times than do the fine arts, and they're surely easier to wax sentimental over, as Margolies does in such locutions as "all of this is gone now, and we won't see the likes of it again," to which most would mutter "big deal" even while yielding to the naive appeal of filling stations done up to look like pagodas, windmills, and pop bottles; of road maps tricked out with dinosaurs and swim-suited cuties; and of the group portrait of Union 76's snappy Sparkle Corps that was supposed to see to it that the company's station rest rooms were clean. Wonderful Americana, deserving of a home in any American public library. <i>Ray Olson</i>Margolies is the ideal tour guide through the ephemera of the American roadside. Bookshelves seem to be bursting with this far-from-scholarly but endearing genre of architectural publishing, and Margolies's pictorial look at the American gas station is a solid addition. Using postcards, his own contemporary photographs, and archival material from a number of petroleum companies, the author offers a bouncy look at a steadily changing highway icon. The spare text is full of tidbits of gasoline retailing lore and its evolution from the homey, early stations through slick industrial modern to the stripped-down self-service outlets of today. But it is the often surprising, occasionally nostalgic images of gas stations, retailing schemes, service station attire, and even road map designs that form this book.

He was liberally educated and left school in 1817. Given a sinecure in the Foreign Office, he spent three dissipated years in St Petersburg writing light, erotic and highly polished verse. He flirted with several pre-Decembrist societies, composing the mildly revolutionary verses which led to his disgrace and exile in 1820. After traveling through the Caucasus and the Crimea, he was sent to Bessarabia, where he wrote <b>The Captive of the Caucasus</b> and <b>The Fountain at Bakhchisaray</b>, and began <b>Eugene Onegin</b>. His work took an increasingly serious turn during the last year of his southern exile, in Odessa. In 1824 he was transferred to his parents&#x2019; estate at Mikhaylovskoe in north-west Russia, where he spent two solitary but fruitful years during which he wrote his historical drama <b>Boris Godunov</b>, continued <b>Eugene Onegin</b> and finished <b>The Gipsies</b>. After the failure of the Decembrist Revolt in 1825 and the succession of a new tsar, Pushkin was granted conditional freedom in 1826. During the next three years he wandered restlessly between St Petersburg and Moscow. He wrote an epic poem, <b>Poltava</b>, but little else. In 1829 he went with the Russian army to Transcaucasia, and the following year, stranded by a cholera outbreak at the small family estate of Boldino, he wrote his experimental <b>Little Tragedies</b> in blank verse and <b>The Tales of Belkin</b> in prose, and virtually completed <b>Eugene Onegin</b>. In 1831 he married the beautiful Natalya Goncharova. The rest of his life was soured by debts and the malice of his enemies. Although his literary output slackened, he produced his major prose works <b>The Queen of Spades</b> and <b>The Captain&#x2019;s Daughter</b>, his masterpiece in verse, <b>The Bronze Horseman</b>, important lyrics and fairy tales, including <b>The Tale of the Golden Cockerel</b>. Towards the end of 1836 anonymous letters goaded Pushkin into challenging a troublesome admirer of his wife to a duel. He was mortally wounded and died in January 1837.One of the finest of all verse translations into English ... reproduces every facet of the original: the precise meaning, the wit, the lyricism.

Walley&#x2019;s world was turned upside down when the steel mill in Southeast Chicago where her father worked abruptly closed. In the ensuing years, ninety thousand other area residents would also lose their jobs in the mills&#x2014;just one example of the vast scale of deindustrialization occurring across the United States. The disruption of this event propelled Walley into a career as a cultural anthropologist, and now, in <i>Exit Zero</i>, she brings her anthropological perspective home, examining the fate of her family and that of blue-collar America at large.&nbsp;Interweaving personal narratives and family photos with a nuanced assessment of the social impacts of deindustrialization, <i>Exit Zero</i> is one part memoir and one part ethnography&#x2014; providing a much-needed female and familial perspective on cultures of labor and their decline. Through vivid accounts of her family&#x2019;s struggles and her own upward mobility, Walley reveals the social landscapes of America&#x2019;s industrial fallout, navigating complex tensions among class, labor, economy, and environment. Unsatisfied with the notion that her family&#x2019;s turmoil was inevitable in the ever-forward progress of the United States, she provides a fresh and important counternarrative that gives a new voice to the many Americans whose distress resulting from deindustrialization has too often been ignored.<br><br> This book is part of a project that also includes a documentary film.</p><p><b>Christine Walley </b>is associate professor of anthropology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of <i>Rough Waters: Nature and Development in an East African Marine Park</i>.&#x201c;Walley . . . writes her book as an autoethnography. This is a form that uses the author&#x2019;s personal experience and reflection as a lens through which to view broader cultural and political trends. It proves to be an effective way of tackling a number of thorny issues like the politics of industrial decline, gender roles in working-class families, racism in white blue collar neighborhoods and the physical and psychic markers of class in America with both clarifying insight and humanizing compassion. Walley&#x2019;s willingness to dive headfirst into questions about the nature of persistent economic segregation seems especially necessary in today&#x2019;s post-Occupy environment where issues of inequality are understood to be important yet still seem unable to be truly addressed.&#x201d; (John M. Tryneski <i>Spectrum Culture</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;How a person feels about herself, as she contemplates her class positioning, is central to <i>Exit Zero</i>, Christine Walley&#x2019;s superb memoir or &#x2018;autoethnography.&#x2019; . . . But there is more here than family history: Walley uses the stories of these people to reflect more generally on the kinds of stories people of the United States tell to make sense of social class and, particularly, of industrial progress and deindustrialization.&#x201d;<br> (Richard Handler <i>American Ethnologist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Exit Zero</i> is a poignant and scholarly engagement with the topics of class and mobility. It offers an accessible entry point for undergraduates and an ideal model of reflexive methodology for advanced readers. It pushes us to ponder fundamental questions about family, national myths, and the end-goal of upward mobility.&#x201d;<br> (Mary Pattillo <i>Contemporary Sociology</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;Exit Zero</i> is a remarkable, erudite book that is gracefully written and deeply grounded in cross-disciplinary scholarship on deindustrialization, inequality, gender, race, and class.&#x201d;<br> (<i>American Anthropologist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In the early years of Working-Class Studies, I worried that we sometimes valorized the personal without demanding that it generate political and scholarly analysis. With Walley&#x2019;s book, we see that this field has developed a signature genre: the hybrid of autobiography and scholarly analysis previously illustrated most effectively by Jack Metzgar in <i>Striking Steel</i> and Barbara Jensen in <i>Reading Classes</i>. Such books go beyond telling working-class stories to demonstrate the critical practice of constructing theories of class through the analysis of experience. <i>Exit Zero</i> offers us both an engaging story and insightful analysis.&#x201d; (Sherry Linkon <i>Working-Class Studies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Exit Zero</i> is an incredibly moving book written by an academic scholar coming to grips with her experience with deindustrialization.&#x201d;<br> (<i>New Labor Forum</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Christine J. Walley&#x2019;s vivid, frank, and insightful autoethnography casts a stark light on the travails of the American working class in the last century. In <i>Exit Zero</i>, she evokes the long hours and dangerous conditions of Chicago&#x2019;s steel mills in their glory days, the heedless dumping of toxic waste that may have made Walley a cancer victim in her twenties, and the terrible toll the mills&#x2019; closing took on middle-aged men who would never work again. Progressive, but never politically correct, Walley gives a warts-and-all portrayal of Chicago&#x2019;s white working class that does not smooth over its racist and sexist underside, while challenging middle-class readers to cast aside their own romanticized or paternalistic stereotypes of the declining white working class.&#x201d; (Hugh Gusterson, George Mason University)<br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Exit Zero</i> is a gem that will appeal to a variety of audiences. Christine Walley&#x2019;s analysis of how community residents in Southeast Chicago&#x2014;and particularly members of her family&#x2014;experienced deindustrialization is sensitive and illuminating, and her discussion of what it was like for her to leave Southeast Chicago to enter the upper-middle class world reinforces her message that the working class world is poorly understood both in popular culture and in mainstream academic literature. In the last full chapter, on the environmental dimension of social class, she breaks new ground. <i>Exit Zero</i> is an intense account of a little-considered part of the American experience.&#x201d;</p><p></p> (David Bensman, Rutgers University 2012-04-26)<br><br>&#x201c;If you thought deindustrialization was something that decimated a few unlucky manufacturing towns back in the 1980s, think again. Christine J. Walley&#x2019;s poignant analytic memoir of family life and class relations after the steel mills closed shows how America is still living out the legacy of those years, decades later. Anyone who wants to understand why the gap between rich and poor keeps widening, why upward mobility has shifted from a collective to an individual project, which misbegotten policies led to this predicament, and how &#x2018;the materiality of class&#x2019; affects us even at the cellular level, can learn from Walley&#x2019;s wise and incisive critique.&#x201d; (Kath Weston, University of Virginia)<br><br>&#x201c;Telling the story of how the demise and collapse of the Southeast Chicago steel industry in the 1980s transformed her family&#x2019;s sense of past and future, Christine J. Walley shows us that analyzing class, gender, and race always demands that we weave between the personal and the political, that we think across the intimate, the institutional, and even the international. <i>Exit Zero</i> is autoethnography, political economy, immigration history, and urban anthropology at its best.&#x201d; (Stefan Helmreich, Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</p><h2>Algebra 1: Expressions, Equations and Applications Solutions Book</h2><p>The front of the book is title~ Algebra I Solutions Expressions, Equations, And Applications by Paul A.

Yes, indeed it was. Tell our grandchildren.<br><br>The Donheads<br><br>He was spectacularly clean. You might say ostentatiously clean. His ancient fingernails were rimmed with purest white. The few still-gold hairs below his knuckles looked always freshly shampooed, as did his curly still-bronze hair. His shoes shone like conkers. His clothes were always freshly pressed. He had the elegance of the 1920s, for his garments, whatever they looked like off, always became him. Always a Victorian silk handkerchief in the breast pocket. Always yellow cotton or silk socks from Harrods; and some still-perfect from his old days in the East. His skin was clear and, in a poor light, young.<br><br>His colleagues at the Bar called him Filth, but not out of irony. It was because he was considered to be the source of the old joke, Failed In London Try Hong Kong. It was said that he had fled the London Bar, very young, very poor, on a sudden whim just after the War, and had done magnificently well in Hong Kong from the start. Being a modest man, they said, he had called himself a parvenu, a fraud, a carefree spirit.<br><br>Filth in fact was no great maker of jokes, was not at all modest about his work and seldom, except in great extremity, went in for whims. He was loved, however, admired, laughed at kindly and still much discussed many years after retirement.<br><br>Now, nearing eighty, he lived alone in Dorset. His wife Betty was dead but he often prattled on to her around the house. Astonishingly in one so old, his curly hair was not yet grey. His eyes and mind alert, he was a delightful man. He had always been thought so. A man whose distinguished life had run steadily and happily. There was no smell of old age about his house. He was rich and took for granted that it (and he) would be kept clean, fed and laundered by servants as it had always been. He knew how to treat servants and they stayed for years.<br><br>Betty had been successful with servants, too. Both she and Old Filth had been born in what Americans called the Orient and the British Raj had called the Far East. They knew who they were, but they were unselfconscious and popular.<br><br>After Betty's death the self-mockery dwindled in Old Filth. His life exploded. He became more ponderous. He began, at first slowly, to flick open shutters on the past that he had, as a sensible man with sensible and learned friends (he was a QC and had been a Judge), kept clamped down.<br><br>His success as an advocate in Hong Kong had been phenomenal for he had had ease, grasp, diligence and flair. His career had taken off the minute he had begun to be briefed by the Straits-Chinese. It was not just that scraps of eastern languages began to re-emerge from his childhood in Malaya, but a feeling of nearness to the Oriental mind. When Old Filth spoke Malay or (less ably) Mandarin, you heard an unsuspected voice. Chinese, Malay and Bengali lawyers &#x2014; though often trained at Oxford and the Inns of Court &#x2014; were thought to be not straightforward but Filth, now Old Filth and after his retirement often Dear Old Filth, had found them perfectly straightforward, and to his taste.<br><br>All his life he kept a regard for Chinese values: the courtesy, the sudden thrust, the holiness of hospitality, the pleasure in money, the decorum, the importance of food, the discretion, the cleverness. He had married a Scotswoman but she had been born in Peking. She was dumpy and tweedy with broad Lanarkshire shoulders and square hands, but she spoke Mandarin perfectly and was much more at home with Chinese ways and idiom than she ever felt on her very rare visits to Scotland. Her passion for jewellery was Chinese and her strong Scottish fingers rattled the trays of jade in the street markets of Kowloon, stirring the stones like pebbles on a beach. 'When you do that,' Old Filth would say &#x2014; when they were young and he was still aware of her all the time &#x2014; 'your eyes are almond-shaped.' 'Poor Old Betty,' he would say to her ghost across in another armchair in the house in Dorset to which they had retired and in which she had died.<br><br>And why ever Dorset? Nobody knew. Some family tradition somewhere perhaps. Filth said it was because he disliked everywhere else in England, Betty because she felt the cold in Scotland. They both had a dismissive attitude towards Wales.<br><br>But if any old pair had been born to become retired ex-pats in Hong Kong, members of the Cricket Club, the Jockey Club, stalwarts of the English Lending Library, props of St Andrew's Church and St John's Cathedral, they were Filth and Betty. People who would always be able to keep servants (Filth was very rich), who would live in a house on The Peak, be forever welcoming hosts to every friend of a friend's friend visiting the Colony. When you thought of Betty, you saw her at her round rosewood dining table, looking quickly about her to see if plates were empty, tinkling her little bell to summon the snakey smiling girls in their household livery of identical cheongsams. Old Filth and Betty were perfectly international people, beloved ornaments at every one of the Memorial Services to old friends, English or Chinese, in the Cathedral. In the last years these deaths had been falling thick and fast upon them.<br><br>Was it perhaps 'The Pound' that drew them to Dorset? The thought of having to survive one day in Hong Kong on a pension? But the part of Dorset they had chosen was far from cheap. Betty was known to 'have her own money' and Filth had always said merrily that he had put off making Judge for as long as possible so that he hadn't to live on a salary.<br><br>And they had no children. No responsibilities. No one to come back to England for.<br><br>Or was it &#x2014; the most likely thing &#x2014; the end of Empire? The drawing-near of 1997? Was it the unbearableness of the thought of the arrival of the barbarians? The now unknown, but certainly changed, Mainland-Chinese whose grandparents had fed the baby Miss Betty on soft, cloudy jellies and told her frightening fairy tales?<br><br>Neither Filth nor Betty cared for the unknown and already, five years before they left, English was not being heard so much in Hong Kong shops and hotels and, when it was heard, it was being spoken less well. Many familiar English and Chinese had disappeared to London or Seattle or Toronto, and many children had vanished to foreign boarding schools. The finest of the big houses on The Peak were in darkness behind steel grilles, and at Betty's favourite jeweller the little girls behind the counter, who sat all day threading beads and who still seemed to look under sixteen although she had known them twenty years, glanced up more slowly now when she rang the bell on the armour-plated door.

In addition to many short stories, plays, and books of criticism, autobiography, and travel, he wrote some twenty novels, the first published being <i>Roderick Hudson</i> (1875). They include <i>The Europeans</i>, <i>Washington Square</i>, <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i>, <i>The Bostonians</i>, <i>The Princess Casamassima</i>, <i>The Tragic Muse, The Spoils of Poynton</i>, <i>The Awkward Age</i>, <i>The Wings of the Dove</i>, <i>The Ambassadors</i>, and <i>The Golden Bowl</i>. Susie Boyt (introduction and notes) is the author of four novels and a memoir, <i>My Judy Garland Life</i>. Philip Horne (editor) is a professor of English at University College London. He is an authority on 19th century literature, specifically Charles Dickens and Henry James. He has edited several editions of James&#x2019;s work, including <i>The Tragic Muse</i> for Penguin Classics.</p><h2>Doctor Faustus (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>Thomas Mann wrote his last great novel, <i>Doctor Faustus</i>, during his exile from Nazi Germany. Although he already had a long string of masterpieces to his name, in retrospect this seems to be the novel he was born to write. <br><br>A modern reworking of the Faust legend in which a twentieth-century composer sells his soul to the devil for the artistic power he craves, the story brilliantly interweaves music, philosophy, theology, and politics. Adrian Leverk�hn is a talented young composer who is willing to go to any lengths to reach greater heights of achievement. What he gets is twenty-four years of genius&#x2014;years of increasingly extraordinary musical innovation intertwined with progressive and destructive madness. <br><br> A scathing allegory of Germany&#x2019;s renunciation of its own humanity and its embrace of ambition and nihilism, <i>Doctor Faustus</i> is also a profound meditation on artistic genius. Obsessively exploring the evil into which his country had fallen, Mann succeeds as only he could have in charting the dimensions of that evil; his novel has both the pertinence of history and the universality of myth. <br> &nbsp;<br> Translated from the German by H.

This book can serve as a technical companion to Ahren&#39;s text or as a stand-alone text. It provides the mathematical equations needed for a higher level of understanding of meteorology. The organization is mapped directly to the Ahrens book, making Stull&#39;s text a perfect companion. More than a lab manual or workbook, this text contains detailed math and physics that expand upon concepts presented in Ahrens&#39; text, as well as numerous solved problems. This text demonstrates how to use mathematical equations (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and finite differential equations) to explain the dominant characteristics of certain atmospheric phenomena and processes.</p><p>Roland Stull is Professor and Chair of Atmospheric Sciences in the Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Canada, and Director of the Geophysical Disaster Computational Fluid Dynamics Center. He was a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for sixteen years before moving to The University of British Columbia in 1995. His early work in boundary-layer meteorology took him to Africa, Europe, and many sites in America for airborne field experiments, while his current research on numerical weather prediction utilizes massively-parallel computer clusters. He has taught courses in 20 different topics, ranging from a survey course on natural disasters with enrollments of 1,000 students, to graduate-level courses on non-linear dynamics and chaos. In addition to METEOROLOGY FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS, he has written an upper-level text, AN INTRODUCTION TO BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY (Kluwer, �1989), which is now in its eighth printing.

It remained in print for 25 years, and was used by both high school and college teachers. Now that interdisciplinary approaches are again highly valued, this anthology of philosophical ideas represented in great literature has made its way back into print. Poetry, plays, novels and short stories are all included, with a biography of each author. Four main selections are based on the Platonic ideas of truth, beauty, and goodness, with a section on commitment which has a modern relevance. Philosophical works introduce each literary section. There are many questions for students, along with introductions to the thought of each philosopher. Plato, Aristotle, Descartes and Kant are included, but most of the philosophers are from the 20th century, like most of the authors. Prominent American women are featured among the writers.Many MySpace pages cite this book as &#34;My favorite book, &#34; or &#34;My favorite pastime&#34;!

He was not only the greatest artist in an age of giants, but a man who reinvented the practice of art itself. Throughout his long career he clashed with patrons by insisting that he had no master but his own demanding muse and promoting the novel idea that it was the artist, rather than the lord who paid for it, who was creative force behind the work.<br> <br>Miles Unger narrates the astonishing life of this driven and difficult man through six of his greatest masterpieces. Each work expanded the expressive range of the medium, from the <i>Piet� </i>Michelangelo carved as a brash young man, to the apocalyptic <i>Last Judgment</i>, the work of an old man tested by personal trials. Throughout the course of his career he explored the full range of human possibility. In the gargantuan <i>David </i>he depicts Man in the glory of his youth, while in the tombs he carved for the Medici he offers a sustained meditation on death and the afterlife. In the Sistine Chapel ceiling he tells the epic story of Creation, from the perfection of God&#x2019;s initial procreative act to the corruption introduced by His imperfect children. In the final decades of his life, his hands too unsteady to wield the brush and chisel, he exercised his mind by raising the soaring vaults and dome of St. Peter&#x2019;s in a final tribute to his God.<br> <br>A work of deep artistic understanding, Miles Unger&#x2019;s <i>Michelangelo</i> brings to life the irascible, egotistical, and undeniably brilliant man whose artistry continues to amaze and inspire us after 500 years.</p><p>Miles J.

MICHAEL, MORE THAN MORTAL MAN, ANGEL DIVINE<p></p> <br>In the spring of 1548, Michelangelo Buonarroti dashed off a brief note to his nephew Lionardo in Florence. As was often the case with the seventy-three-year-old artist, he felt aggrieved. &#x201c;Tell the priest not to write me any longer as &#x2018;Michelangelo sculptor,&#x2019; &#x201d; he wrote in a huff, &#x201c;because here [in Rome] I&#x2019;m known only as Michelangelo Buonarroti, and if a Florentine citizen wants to have an altarpiece painted, he must find himself a painter. I was never a painter or a sculptor like one who keeps a shop. I haven&#x2019;t done so in order to uphold the honor of my father and brothers. While it is true that I have served three popes, that was only because I was forced to.&#x201d;<br> <br>One reason for his annoyance was practical. As he suggests at the end of the letter where he enlists his nephew in a little deception&#x2014;&#x201c;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as to what I&#x2019;ve just written, don&#x2019;t say anything to the priest because I wish him to think that I never received your letter&#x201d;&#x2014;there are other sculptors in Rome with similar names and any imprecision in the form of the address is likely to cause his mail to go astray. But the real explanation lies elsewhere. The priest has not only been careless: worse, he has misunderstood the nature of his calling. Michelangelo bristles at being mistaken for one of those daubers who hangs out a shingle advertising Madonnas and portraits to order and priced by the square foot. Nothing could be further from the truth, he tells Lionardo, as if he too needed to be reminded of the kind of man his uncle is. He is an artist, a visionary whose unique gift sets him apart from ordinary mortals.<br> <br>In this petulant note&#x2014;written in haste by an old man whose crankiness was exacerbated by a recent attack of kidney stones&#x2014;we can sense the frustration that came from a lifetime spent battling those who viewed his profession with contempt. In the face of the skeptics and the scoffers, Michelangelo promoted a new conception of the artist, one in which the crass demands of commerce and the demeaning associations of manual labor have been sloughed off to reveal a creature as yet ill-defined but still thoroughly magnificent.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was never a painter or a sculptor like one who keeps a shop,&#x201d; he insists. But if not, what kind of artist is he? Implicit in Michelangelo&#x2019;s outburst is a radical claim: the painter or sculptor was no longer just a humble craftsman but a shaman or secular prophet, and the work of his hands was akin to holy writ.<br> <br>Michelangelo&#x2019;s letter to his nephew offers a telling insight into the artist&#x2019;s state of mind, one that&#x2019;s all the more valuable for being private and unrehearsed. Precisely because there&#x2019;s so little at stake, and because the people involved were of no particular importance, we get the feeling we are peeking through the curtains and seeing the man as he really was when no one was looking, in his robe and slippers, his hair uncombed. The touchiness and fragile vanity Michelangelo displays are perhaps surprising, since by the time he wrote the letter he had already achieved a worldly success almost unparalleled for any artist in any age. &#x201c;[W]hat greater and clearer sign can we ever have of the excellence of this man than the contention of the Princes of the world for him?&#x201d; asked Ascanio Condivi, his friend and biographer. Courted by the greatest lords of Europe who begged for even a minor work from his hands, why bother to respond to a tactless Florentine nobody?<br> <br>The truth is that the priest had touched him where he was most tender. Michelangelo&#x2019;s peevish response is a farcical echo of those epic battles with popes and princes who were often just as blind to the nature of his achievement. In fact, Michelangelo&#x2019;s entire life was a rebuke to those who thought the artist&#x2019;s job was to supply pretty images to order for anyone with a few ducats in his pocket. Michelangelo insisted that the purpose of art, at least when practiced at the highest level, was to channel the most profound aspirations of the human spirit. These could not be summoned at will or purchased like melons in the market. By stubbornly, even pugnaciously, pursuing this ideal, Michelangelo transformed both the practice of art and our conception of the artist&#x2019;s role in society.<br> <br>Michelangelo&#x2019;s long, illustrious career marks the point at which the artist definitively transcends his humble origins in the laboring class and takes his place alongside scholars and princes of the Church as an intellectual and spiritual leader. As Michelangelo&#x2019;s fame spread, some of his patrons persisted in treating him as little more than a household servant&#x2014;albeit of a particularly eccentric and disobedient sort&#x2014;but many contemporaries acknowledged that he was a new kind of artist, indeed a new kind of man, a secular saint who was to be exalted but also feared. Even someone as powerful as Pope Leo X was daunted by the prospect of employing him, grumbling, &#x201c;[H]e is terrible, as you see. It is impossible to work with him.&#x201d; Leo&#x2019;s cousin, Pope Clement VII, was more amused than outraged at his servant&#x2019;s insubordination. &#x201c;When Buonarroti comes to see me,&#x201d; he said, laughing, &#x201c;I always take a seat and bid him to be seated, feeling that he will do so without leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>Michelangelo&#x2019;s determination to chart a new course embroiled him in endless quarrels as his claim of superiority clashed with his employers&#x2019; own considerable egos. While patrons tended to regard him and his colleagues as, at best, highly trained professionals tasked with carrying out their vision, Michelangelo insisted on an unprecedented degree of freedom to pursue his own vision, on his own terms. Cardinal Cervini (soon to be elected Pope Marcellus II), in charge of overseeing the rebuilding of St. Peter&#x2019;s, was one of many who discovered how difficult it was to control the headstrong artist. When he asked Michelangelo to inform him of his plans, the artist snapped; &#x201c;I am not obliged, nor do I intend to be obliged to say either to your highness or to any other person what I am bound or desirous to do.&#x201d; Even when his relationship with a patron was one of mutual respect, Michelangelo chafed at any restrictions placed on his freedom. &#x201c;If Your Holiness wishes me to accomplish anything,&#x201d; he wrote to Pope Clement VII, &#x201c;I beg you not to have authorities set over me in my own trade, but to have faith in me and give me a free hand. Your Holiness will see what I shall accomplish and the account I shall give of myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Michelangelo&#x2019;s greatest achievement was to fuse the artist and his work. He was the prototype of the temperamental genius, beholden to no one and responsible only to the dictates of his own inspiration. The term terribilit�&#x2014;the power to inspire awe and terror&#x2014;was transferred by some subtle alchemy from the artist to his paintings and sculptures, and then back again, so that the man and his work became one. Michelangelo himself tended to blur the line between life and art. Asked why he never married, he responded, &#x201c;I have too much of a wife, which is this art that has always given me tribulation, and my children will be the works that I shall leave.&#x201d; In a sonnet, he took this analogy one step further, writing of his unforgiving muse:<br> <br>This savage woman, by no strictures bound,<br> <br>Has ruled that I&#x2019;m to burn, die, suffer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>My blood, however, she drains pound by pound;<br> <br>She strips my nerves the better to undo<br> <br>My soul.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Fueled by his outsized ambition and stamped by his outsized personality, these epic paintings and monumental sculptures reflect their creator; they are an expression of his will and a mirror held up to his turbulent soul. It required a leap of faith to commission a work from such a master, since it was certain to defy convention. When finally unveiled to a curious public, the work was likely to challenge not only artistic precedent but often orthodoxy itself. In the case of The Last Judgment, the outcry from indignant Christians was so loud that even the pope could not resist their calls to cover up the most offensive parts. Those who preferred to play it safe simply hired more pliant servants.<br> <br>Even in an age of towering giants, Michelangelo was the first artist to be the subject of a cult of personality. His character was as much a matter for public speculation as the meaning of the works he created, and it was impossible to understand the one without the insight provided by the other. It has become a clich� to say that an artist must express himself in his work, but this commonplace was largely Michelangelo&#x2019;s invention. To be an artist in the new sense of the word, it was not sufficient to possess supreme skill. Skill was only the means to an end, which was to make the work embody the self.<br> <br>This explains why the private lives of his great rivals&#x2014;Leonardo, Raphael, and Titian, to name only the most prominent&#x2014;were never subject to the same kind of scrutiny that routinely followed Michelangelo. Most focused on his eccentricities, his preference for solitude, his melancholy, his ill temper. Even his personal hygiene became a matter of public comment. &#x201c;[W]hile a man of so great genius,&#x201d; an early chronicler observed, &#x201c;he was by nature so coarse and wild as to inform his domestic life with an incredible shabbiness.&#x201d;<br> <br>But rather than diminish his reputation, these observations merely heightened Michelangelo&#x2019;s mystique. Michelangelo was the first truly modern artist, emancipated not only from a slavish subservience to his patrons but from social norms altogether. His brooding temperament and contempt for social norms was a crucial aspect of a mythologizing that began in his own lifetime. As a youth, recalled Condivi, &#x201c;he almost withdrew from the fellowship of men, only consorting with a few. So that by some he was held to be proud, and by others odd and eccentric &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. company not only did not please him but even annoyed him, as interrupting his meditations; he was never less solitary than when alone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Because his contemporaries were fascinated with details of his private life, Michelangelo, even after the passage of five centuries, comes across as a fully formed human being: driven, passionate, mercurial, irascible, devoted to his few close friends but also quick to accuse them of betrayal. He could inspire fierce loyalty, but also an intense aversion, particularly among those who felt the bite of his anger or the sting of his ridicule. To some of his employees he acted like an indulgent father, nursing them when they were sick or providing generously for their families after they died. But he could also treat his underlings harshly, dismissing them for minor offenses and then publicizing their faults so they had difficulty finding any other work. He was generous to those he considered the deserving poor, but his tendency to pocket his commissions and then fail to deliver what he &#x2019;d promised led to charges of greed and even outright fraud.<br> <br>Even so, one must be careful not to accept everything at face value. Both he and his allies recognized that even a &#x201c;warts-and-all&#x201d; depiction could work to his advantage. In flouting norms he merely confirmed his originality, and it was originality that distinguished the true artist from the humble craftsman, the creative genius from the hack. Who&#x2019;s ever heard of a tormented carpenter? Or a mercurial glass blower? Of course, these skilled trades have their share of neurotics, but no one believes it&#x2019;s part of the job description.<br> <br>Michelangelo, by contrast, deliberately broke down the barriers between life and art, setting up a paradigm&#x2014;most fully embraced by the Romantic movement in the nineteenth century&#x2014;in which suffering is regarded as the basis of creativity. In his poetry, Michelangelo lays bare his troubles, his vaunting pride and crippling doubt, the exaltation of desire and the crushing burden of shame. &#x201c;I live to sin,&#x201d; he despaired in an unfinished madrigal,<br> <br>for the soul that living dies,<br> <br>my life being no more mine,<br> <br>but to wickedness enslaved.<br> <br>Works like the famous Captives or the late piet�s are almost equally confessional. Even when the artist does not appear onstage, we can feel him lurking in the background, dominating the action through the force of his will.<br> <br>Michelangelo was fully complicit in the project to turn his life into legend. His earliest biographers, Condivi and Vasari, were younger colleagues who stood in awe of the great man and were only too happy to promote him as a demigod who trafficked in only the most profound truths. The writer Anton Francesco Doni remarked, as if it were common knowledge: &#x201c;And certainly I take you to be a God,&#x201d; though he added the disclaimer, &#x201c;but with license from our faith.&#x201d; Others took up the torch as well. In his epic poem Orlando Furioso, Ludovico Ariosto puns on the artist&#x2019;s name, calling him &#x201c;Michel, pi� che mortale, Angelo divino&#x201d; (Michael, more than mortal man, angel divine), though what began as praise could be turned by his enemies into a source of derision. The equally distinguished Pietro Aretino, smarting from a perceived insult at the hands of the artist, wrote a letter in which he sneered at &#x201c;that Michelangelo of stupendous fame &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who since you are divine do not deign to consort with men,&#x201d; proving that a social-climbing man of letters could be every bit as touchy as an insecure artist.<br> <br>Michelangelo&#x2019;s conception of himself as a superior being was not based solely, or perhaps even principally, on his immense talent. As his letter to his nephew reveals, it sprang initially from his pride in belonging to an ancient and noble lineage. &#x201c;[H]ere I&#x2019;m known only as Michelangelo Buonarroti,&#x201d; he boasts, as if it is the family name rather than his profession that best defines him. Obsessed with upholding the family honor, he cannot embrace the title of sculptor or painter, which he associates with degraded manual labor. The priest&#x2019;s error is not that he looked down on the great majority of artists, but rather that he associated him with that lowly breed.<br> <br>Driven to become an artist, a profession he knew was beneath his dignity, Michelangelo simply redefined the term. Ironically, the new reality Michelangelo himself helped bring about makes his anxiety about the family pedigree seem faintly ridiculous. The Buonarroti would long ago have faded into obscurity were it not for the famous artist who bore that name, a reversal of the natural order to which Michelangelo never fully reconciled himself.<br> II. THE PAINTER&#x2019;S APPRENTICE<p></p> <br>Michelangelo&#x2019;s decision to become an artist sprang from a deep need, but his restless ambition and his irritable pride were fueled as much by the circumstances of his birth, or at least the circumstances as he understood them, since the basis of his family&#x2019;s claims to nobility was as much a product of hope as of cold-eyed realism. Michelangelo di Lodovico di Buonarroti SimoneI was born on March 6, 1475, in the provincial village of Caprese, where his father, Lodovico, was serving a term as the mayor. In a typically dry entry, Lodovico marked the momentous occasion in his Ricordanza: &#x201c;I record that today, ...</p><h2>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, The Girls of Slender Means, The Driver&#39;s Seat, The Only Problem: Introduction by Frank Kermode (Everyman&#39;s Library Contemporary Classics Series)</h2><p><p>The brevity of Muriel Spark&#x2019;s novels is equaled only by their brilliance.

For more than a year, Christopher Darden argued tirelessly for the prosecution, giving voice to the victims in the 0.J. Simpson murder trial. In Contempt is an unflinching look at what the television cameras could not show: behind-the-scenes meetings, the deteriorating relationships between the defense and prosecution teams, the taunting, baiting, and pushing matches between Darden and Simpson, the intimate relationship between Darden and Marcia Clark, and the candid factors behind Darden&#39;s controversial decision for Simpson to try on the infamous glove, and much more. Out of the sensational frenzy of &#34;the trial of the century&#34; comes this haunting memoir of duty, justice, and the powerful undertow of American racism.

Written in 1922, it was recently rediscovered as a miniature book in Queen Mary's dollhouse in Windsor Castle. Witty and stylish, the story recounts the antics of a time-traveling sprite who inhabits the dollhouse. This illustrated, cloth-bound edition presents the story for the first time since 1924. Lovers of literature and history will rejoice in this irresistible collector's item and one-of-a-kind literary gift.</p><p>Vita Sackville-West (1892&#x2013;1962) was a celebrated English writer and garden designer associated with the Bloomsbury Group.

Funny, satiric, and human, it follows Huck from a boy&#39;s innocence to a man&#39;s wisdom.</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

This is an investigation into the history of that idea and of its profound influence on European thought, culture and history. <br> <p>From the early Dark Ages to the Renaissance it was widely believed that the language spoken in the Garden of Eden was just such a language, and that all current languages were its decadent descendants from the catastrophe of the Fall and at Babel. The recovery of that language would, for theologians, express the nature of divinity, for cabbalists allow access to hidden knowledge and power, and for philosophers reveal the nature of truth. Versions of these ideas remained current in the Enlightenment, and have recently received fresh impetus in attempts to create a natural language for artificial intelligence.<br> </p> <p>The story that Umberto Eco tells ranges widely from the writings of Augustine, Dante, Descartes and Rousseau, arcane treatises on cabbalism and magic, to the history of the study of language and its origins. He demonstrates the initimate relation between language and identity and describes, for example, how and why the Irish, English, Germans and Swedes - one of whom presented God talking in Swedish to Adam, who replied in Danish, while the serpent tempted Eve in French - have variously claimed their language as closest to the original. He also shows how the late eighteenth-century discovery of a proto-language (Indo-European) for the Aryan peoples was perverted to support notions of racial superiority.<br> </p> <p><br> </p> <p>To this subtle exposition of a history of extraordinary complexity, Umberto Eco links the associated history of the manner in which the sounds of language and concepts have been written and symbolized. Lucidly and wittily written, the book is, in sum, a <i>tour de force</i> of scholarly detection and cultural interpretation, providing a series of original perspectives on two thousand years of European History.<br> </p> <p>The paperback edition of this book is not available through Blackwell outside of North America.</p></p><p><b>Umberto Eco</b> was born in Alessandria in 1932 and has been Professor of Semiotics at the University of Bologna since 1975 and the President of the International Center for Semiotic and Cognitive Studies at the Universityu of San Marino since 1988.

Calhoun and the Price of Union (Southern biography series)</h2><p>In the first full-scale biography of Calhoun in almost fifty years, John Niven presents a new interpretation of this preeminent spokesman of the Old South. Skillfully blending Calhoun&#39;s public career with important elements of his private life, Niven shows Calhoun to have been at once a more consistent politician and a more complex human being than previous historians have portrayed. This masterly retelling of John C. Calhoun&#39;s eventful life is a model biography.</p><p>Slaveholder, Senator from South Carolina, secretary of state, secretary of war and vice-president under the administrations of John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson, Calhoun (1782-1850) is portrayed as ambitious but deeply insecure, riven by conflict in both his political and private lives, by Niven, author of Martin Van Buren and The Romantic Era of American Politics. Because of his role in instigating the War of 1812, the author charges, Calhoun nearly destroyed the Union that he professed to support, while his struggle for a unified South and his intransigent defense of the Southern way of life helped to doom it. In this comprehensive study, Niven traces 40 years of complex national and state politics and bitter rivalries, and sympathetically portays Calhoun's domestic trials and recurring health problems. He died in despair, we're shown, anticipating the dissolution of the Union.

While based on a thorough study of the Greek text, the commentary introductions and expositions contain a minimum of Greek references. The NICNT authors evaluate significant textual problems and take into account the most important exegetical literature. More technical aspects -- such as grammatical, textual, and historical problems -- are dealt with in footnotes, special notes, and appendixes.</p><p></p><h2>Invertebrate Zoology</h2><p>Ruppert/Barnes&#39; best-selling introduction to the biology of invertebrates is highly regarded for its accuracy and strong research base.

Some students are strong in certain areas and some are strong in others, but no one is equally capable in all. Yet most schools still cling to a one-size-fits-all education philosophy. As a result, many children struggle because their learning patterns don't fit the way they are being taught. <br> In his #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>A Mind at a Time,</i> Dr. Levine shows parents and those who care for children how to identify these individual learning patterns, explaining how they can strengthen a child's abilities and either bypass or help overcome the child's weaknesses, producing positive results instead of repeated frustration and failure. <br> Consistent progress can result when we understand that not every child can do equally well in every type of learning and begin to pay more attention to individual learning patterns -- and individual minds -- so that we can maximize children's success and gratification in life. In <i>A Mind at a Time</i> Dr. Levine shows us how.</p><p>Recognizing each child's intellectual, emotional, and physical strengths--and teaching directly to these strengths--is key to sculpting "a mind at a time," according to Dr. Mel Levine. While this flashing yellow light will not surprise many skilled educators, limited resources often prevent them from shifting their instructional gears. But to teachers and parents whose children face daily humiliation at school, the author bellows, "Try harder!" A professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina Medical School, Levine eloquently substantiates his claim that developmental growth deserves the same monitoring as a child's physical growth. <p> Tales of creative, clumsy, impulsive, nerdy, intuitive, loud-mouthed, and painfully shy kids help Levine define eight specific mind systems (attention, memory, language, spatial ordering, sequential ordering, motor, higher thinking, and social thinking). Levine also incorporates scientific research to show readers how the eight neurodevelopmental systems evolve, interact, and contribute to a child's success in school. Detailed steps describe how mental processes (like problem solving) work for capable kids, and how they can be finessed to serve those who struggle. Clear, practical suggestions for fostering self-monitoring skills and building self-esteem add the most important elements to this essential--yet challenging--program for "raisin' brain." <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p><b>Mel Levine, M.D.,</b> is professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina Medical School and director of its Clinical Center for the Study of Development and Learning.

Often referred to as the Bard of Avon, Shakespeare's vast body of work includes&nbsp;comedic, tragic, and historical plays;&nbsp;poems; and 154 sonnets.&nbsp;His dramatic works have been translated into every major language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.<i>Introduction<br></i><br><br>Shakespeare probably wrote <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> in 1606 or 1607; it was registered for publication on May 20, 1608, and apparently influenced a revision of Samuel Daniel&#x2019;s <i>Cleopatra</i> that was published &#x201c;newly altered&#x201d; in 1607. Antony and Cleopatra was thus roughly contemporary with <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Macbeth</i>. Yet the contrast between those two tragedies and Antony and Cleopatra is immense. Unlike <i>Macbeth</i>, with its taut focus on a murderer and his wife, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> moves back and forth across the Mediterranean in its epic survey of characters and events, bringing together the fates of Pompey, Octavius Caesar, Octavia, and Lepidus with those of the protagonists. <i>King Lear</i> gives proper names to fourteen characters, Macbeth to eighteen, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> to thirty-four. The Roman play requires no fewer than forty-two separate scenes, of which most occur in what modern editors label Acts 3 and 4, although no play is less suited to the classical rigors of five-act structure, and these divisions are not found in the reliable Folio text of 1623. Indeed, it is as though Shakespeare resolved at the height of his career to show that he could dispense entirely with the classical &#x201c;rules,&#x201d; which had never taken serious hold of the English popular stage in any case. The flouting of the unities is so extreme that John Dryden, in his <i>All for Love, or The World Well Lost </i>(1678), undertook not so much to revise Shakespeare as to start afresh on the same subject. Dryden&#x2019;s play is restricted to the last few hours of the protagonists&#x2019; lives, at Cleopatra&#x2019;s tomb in Alexandria, with a severely limited cast of characters and much of the narrative revealed through recollection. Although a substantial achievement in its own right, <i>All for Love</i> surely demonstrates that Shakespeare knew what he was doing, for Dryden has excised a good deal of the panorama, the excitement, and the &#x201c;infinite variety&#x201d; (2.2.246).<br><br>Shakespeare departs also from the somber tone of his tragedies of evil. He creates, instead, a world that bears affinities to the ambiguous conflicts of the other Roman plays, to the varying humorous perspectives of the comedies, and to the imaginative reconstructions of the late romances. As protagonists, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> lack tragic stature, or so it first appears: she is a tawny gypsy temptress and he a &#x201c;strumpet&#x2019;s fool,&#x201d; a once-great general now bound in &#x201c;strong Egyptian fetters&#x201d; and lost in &#x201c;dotage&#x201d; (1.1.13; 1.2.122&#x2014;3). Several scenes, especially those set in Egypt, are comic and delightfully bawdy: Charmian learning her fortune from the soothsayer, Cleopatra practicing her charms in vain to keep Antony from leaving Egypt or raunchily daydreaming of being Antony&#x2019;s horse &#x201c;to bear the weight of Antony&#x201d; (1.5.22), Cleopatra flying into a magnificent rage at the news of Antony&#x2019;s marriage to Octavia and then consoling herself with catty reflections on Octavia&#x2019;s reported low voice and shortness of stature (&#x201c;I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue, and dwarfish,&#x201d; 3.3.17). In its comic texture, the play somewhat resembles <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, an earlier play about a younger pair of lovers, although there the bawdry is used chiefly to characterize the lovers&#x2019; companions and confidants, whereas in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> it is central to our vision of Cleopatra especially. In any case, the later play is a tragedy about lovers who, despite their quarrels and uncertainties and betrayals of self, are reconciled in a vision of the greatness of their love. In its depiction of two contrasting worlds, also, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> recalls the movement of several earlier comedies from the realistic world of political conniving to a dream-world of the romantic and the unexpected. We can endorse neither world fully in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, and, accordingly, the vision of life presented is often ambivalent and ironic as much as it is tragic. The contrast of values separating Egypt and Rome underscores the paradox of humanity&#x2019;s quest for seemingly irreconcilable goals. The ending is neither a triumph nor a defeat for the lovers but something of both. If Antony and Cleopatra seem in one way too small to be tragic protagonists, in another way they seem too large, creating imaginative visions of themselves and their union that escape the realm of tragedy altogether. Our attention is focused less on the way in which the protagonists come to understand some meaningful relationship between their character and the fate required of them by a tragic universe than on the almost comic way in which the absurdities of Roman worldly striving and Egyptian dissipation are transfigured in the world of the imagination.<br><br>The Roman point of view opens the play and never entirely loses its force. At first, it may seem superior to that of Egypt. Demetrius and Philo, who invite us to view the play&#x2019;s first encounter between Antony and Cleopatra (1.1) from the perspective of the professional Roman soldier, lament the decline of Antony into Circean enslavement. Their tragic concept is of the Fall of Princes, all the more soberly edifying because of the height from which Antony has toppled. &#x201c;You shall see in him / The triple pillar of the world transformed / Into a strumpet&#x2019;s fool&#x201d; (1.1.11&#x2014;13). Egypt is enchanting but clearly enervating&#x2013;a bizarre assemblage of soothsayers, eunuchs, and waiting- gentlewomen who wish to be &#x201c;married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all&#x201d; (1.2.28&#x2014;9). Their mirth is all bawdry, tinged with practices, such as transvestitism, that Roman custom views as licentious. The prevailing images are of procreation in various shapes, sleep (mandragora, Lethe), the oriental opulence of Cleopatra&#x2019;s barge (a golden poop, purple sails, silver oars, divers-colored fans), Epicurean feasting, and drinking. As Enobarbus says, &#x201c;Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be&#x2013;drunk to bed&#x201d; (1.2.47&#x2014;8).<br><br>Antony, for all his reckless defiance of Rome, agrees in his more reflective moments with what Demetrius and Philo have said. &#x201c;A Roman thought hath struck him,&#x201d; Cleopatra observantly remarks, and Antony has indeed determined that &#x201c;I must from this enchanting queen break off&#x201d; (1.2.88, 135). His later return to Cleopatra is at least in part a surrender, a betrayal of his marriage vows to Octavia and his political assurances to Caesar. In the ensuing battles, Antony submits himself dangerously to Cleopatra&#x2019;s governance, and this inversion of dominance in sexual roles, as conventionally understood by the Roman patriarchal world, is emblematic of a deeper disorder within Antony. As Enobarbus concludes bitterly, Antony &#x201c;would make his will / Lord of his reason&#x201d; and so has subverted his &#x201c;judgment&#x201d; (3.13.3&#x2014;4, 37) to passion.<br><br>From the beginning, Cleopatra has sought dominance over Antony in the war of the sexes. When Antony first came to her on the River Cydnus, we learn, he was so overcome in all his senses that he was &#x201c;barbered ten times o&#x2019;er&#x201d; (2.2.234). Cleopatra boasts that she &#x201c;angled&#x201d; for Antony on many occasions, catching him the way fishermen &#x201c;betray&#x201d; fish, and that, when she had &#x201c;drunk him to his bed,&#x201d; she &#x201c;put my tires and mantles on him, whilst / I wore his sword Philippan&#x201d; (2.5.10&#x2014;23). Caesar, affronted by such transvestite debauchery, charges that Antony &#x201c;is not more manlike / Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy / More womanly than he&#x201d; (1.4.5&#x2014;7). During the battle scenes, Antony&#x2019;s followers complain that &#x201c;Photinus, an eunuch&#x201d; (probably Mardian), and Cleopatra&#x2019;s maids manage the war: &#x201c;So our leader&#x2019;s led, / And we are women&#x2019;s men&#x201d; (3.7.14&#x2014;15, 70&#x2014;1). Antony confesses too late that they were right. He becomes a &#x201c;doting mallard,&#x201d; one whose heart is &#x201c;tied by th&#x2019; strings&#x201d; to Cleopatra&#x2019;s rudder when her ships retreat in the first naval engagement (3.10.20; 3.11.56). In the mythic images used to raise their relationship to heroic proportions, Antony is like Mars to Cleopatra&#x2019;s Venus (1.5.19), in both a positive and a negative sense. The image has positive connotations of the way in which, as Milton puts it, the &#x201c;two great sexes animate the world,&#x201d; the masterful soldier and his attractive consort complementing one another in a right relationship of martial prowess and beauty, bravery and love, reason and will; however, to the Renaissance, the myth of Mars and Venus could also be read in a destructive sense, as an adulterous relationship in which reason is subverted to appetite. In another mythic comparison, Antony is like Hercules, not in his prime, but with the shirt of Nessus on his back&#x2013;a poisoned shirt given to Hercules by his wife in a mistaken hope of thereby assuring his love for her (4.12.43). Antony&#x2019;s soldiers understandably believe that the god Hercules has deserted his reputed descendant and onetime champion (4.3.21&#x2014;2).<br><br>Despite Antony&#x2019;s shameful violation of manhood, honor, attention to duty, self-knowledge, and all that Rome stands for, however, the end of his story is anything but a one-sided endorsement for the Roman point of view. The actual Rome, disfigured by political conniving, falls far short of the ideal. Antony has a point when he protests that &#x201c;Kingdoms are clay&#x201d; (1.1.37). Alliances are unstable and are governed by mere political expediency. At first, Antony&#x2019;s wife Fulvia and his brother Lucius have fought one another until forced to unite against the greater threat of Octavius Caesar. Similarly, Antony and Caesar come together only because Pompey has become dangerously powerful at sea and has won the favor of the fickle mob, &#x201c;Our slippery people&#x201d; (1.2.192). This d�tente is not meant to last. As Enobarbus bluntly puts it, &#x201c;if you borrow one another&#x2019;s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again&#x201d; (2.2.109&#x2014;11). Enobarbus is rebuked for his unstatesmanlike tone, but no one denies the validity of what he says. In this cynical negotiation, Octavia is a pawn between husband and brother, shabbily treated by both. Caesar coldly bargains away the happiness of the one person of whom he protests that &#x201c;no brother / Did ever love so dearly&#x201d; (2.2.159&#x2014;60). Antony, although hating false promises and resolving to be loyal to Octavia, knows within himself that it won&#x2019;t work. To make matters worse for the fair-minded Antony, he has received great favors from Pompey that he must now uncharitably repudiate in the interests of politics. Pompey does not miss the opportunity to remind Antony of his ingratitude, but the prevailing mood is not so much of bitterness as of ironic futility. Old friendships must be sacrificed; no one seems wholly to blame, and no one can stop the game. Pompey is as much in the wrong as anyone and as powerless. Despite his idealistic hope of restoring republican government to Rome, he has had to ally himself with pirates who offer him sinister temptations. He could be &#x201c;lord of all the world&#x201d; (2.7.62) if he would only murder on occasion, but Pompey is destined to be trapped between lofty ends and ignoble means. Lepidus is still another dismaying victim of political callousness, used condescendingly by Caesar and permitted to drink himself into oblivion, until he is cashiered on a trumped-up charge and imprisoned for life.<br><br>Octavius Caesar embodies most of all the ironic limits of political ambition. He has avoided enslavement to passion at the very real cost of enslaving himself to his public career as general, triumvir, and future emperor. His ideal warrior is one who, driven by military necessity, would &#x201c;drink / The stale [urine] of horses and the gilded puddle / Which beasts would cough at&#x201d; (1.4.62&#x2014;4). As a general, he is Antony&#x2019;s opposite in every way. He attacks only when he has the advantage and places those who have deserted Antony in his own front lines so &#x201c;That Antony may seem to spend his fury / Upon himself&#x201d; (4.6.10&#x2014;11). He controls his supplies cannily, believing it a &#x201c;waste&#x201d; to feast his army (4.1.17). He, of course, declines Antony&#x2019;s offers of single combat. Antony meantime recklessly accepts Caesar&#x2019;s challenge to fight at sea, feasts debauchingly in one &#x201c;gaudy night&#x201d; after another (3.13.186), and generously refuses to blame or penalize those who leave him. His sending Enobarbus&#x2019;s belongings after him into Caesar&#x2019;s camp convinces that honest soldier he has made a fatal error, for, however imprudent Antony&#x2019;s chivalry may be, it is unquestionably noble and great-hearted. Caesar is a superb general and political genius, but he is also a military automaton, a logistical reckoner, a Machiavellian pragmatist. In his personal life, he is no less austere and puritanical. He deplores loosening his tongue with alcohol. About women, he is deeply cynical, believing that &#x201c;want will perjure / The ne&#x2019;er-touched vestal&#x201d; (3.12.30&#x2014;1). Between him and Cleopatra, there is a profound antipathy, based in part on his revulsion at her earlier affair with his namesake and adoptive father, Julius Caesar (3.6.6). Cleopatra may entertain briefly the notion of trying to seduce this new Caesar (3.13.46 ff.), for like Charmian she loves long life &#x201c;better than figs&#x201d; (1.2.34), but, if so, she soon discovers that she and Caesar are not compatible. All that he represents she must instead grandly repudiate, choosing death and the fantasy of an eternity with Antony as her way to &#x201c;call great Caesar ass / Unpolicied&#x201d; (5.2.307&#x2014;8).</p><h2>Foreign devils on the Silk Road: The search for the lost cities and treasures of Chinese Central Asia (Oxford University Press paperback)</h2><p>The Silk Road, the great trans-Asian highway linking Imperial Rome to China, reached the height of its importance during the T&#39;ang Dynasty. Along it travelled precious cargoes as well as new ideas, art and knowledge. Its oasis towns blossomed into thriving centres of trade. However, as the Chinese lost control of the region, it began to decline to the point where the towns disappeared beneath desert sands. Local legends grew of buried treasure guarded by demons. This is the story of the intrepid adventurers who, at great personal risk, led long-range archaeological raids to the region in the early years of the 20th century. Profiles of such archaeologists as Sir Aurel Stein, who carried off large quantities of priceless wall paintings, sculptures, silks and early manuscripts, augment a narrative which also traces the fate of the works of art that were removed.</p><p>Peter Hopkirk travelled widely in the regions where his six books are set - Central Asia, the Caucasus, China, India and Pakistan, Iran, and Eastern Turkey.

Composed more than two thousand years ago, this book of the Old Testament is not only an essential religious and literary text, but also a source of inspiration to modern-day poets and lovers. Enhanced by an Afterword by the esteemed scholar Robert Alter and a new Foreword from the noted translator Stephen Mitchell, this definitive volume showcases Chana Bloch and Ariel Bloch&#x2019;s sensuous translation which has &#x201c;a lyrical purity that is delightful&#x201d; (W. S. Merwin).</p><p>Ariel and Chana Bloch's new translation of the <i>Song of Songs</i>--the most sexually explicit and sensually rich book of the Bible--is pure delight from beginning to end. Its introduction is an accessible, sophisticated, entertaining, and comprehensive orientation to the literary and religious history of the <i>Song of Songs</i>. The Blochs say the speakers in this poem "don't suffer love, they savor it." Their translation, overflowing with full--almost to the point of florid--feeling ("Feast, friends, and drink / till you are drunk with love!"), arrives at a time when many Jews and Christians are opening themselves to the religious dimensions of sexuality and human love. <i>Song of Songs</i> has a great deal to teach us; this translation is sure to attract many eager students. --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>Ariel Bloch and I were moved to translate the Song of Songs because we felt that none of the translations into English fully conveyed the richness and sensuousness of the Hebrew. It is a poem that evokes the erotic yearning between two passionate young lovers. The most impressive English translation is the King James Version (1611); this magnificent poem, with its rich textures and resounding cadences, has been justly beloved by generations of readers. Nonetheless, significant advances in biblical scholarship during the past four centuries have shown many of its readings to be in error, including some of the best-known verses, such as "Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples" (2:5) or "terrible as an army with banners" (6:10). And its language is often dated, such as "I am sick of love" (2:5) or the unfortunate "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him" (5:4). Finally, the Song in the King James Version is very stately and formal; you would never guess<p>from reading it that this is a poem about young lovers. </p><p>On the other hand, just as earlier interpretations typically erred on the side of prudishness, contemporary translations sometimes verge on crudeness, as in a translation by a distinguished scholar: "Your vulva [is] a rounded crater; / May it never lack punch!" (7:3). </p><p>Moreover, our translation corrects the standard misreading of the Song, as exemplified by two key words. In most translations the woman wears a veil, but we show that this reading is not supported by the Hebrew. That incongruous veil, like the fig leaf of Renaissance painting and sculpture, is a sign of the discomfort of the exegetes. When we lift the veil from her face, she is revealed as a passionate young woman, as spirited and assertive as Juliet. </p><p>The other key word is commonly translated "love", including in the opening verse "Your love is better than wine", though it refers exclusively to sexual love. </p><p>One of the major challenges we faced in translating the Song was to find the proper register in English, neither too formal and stylized nor too breezy and colloquial, language that is fresh and urgent and passionate, and at the same time dignified. Our aim was to convey the heat, the speed, the intensity of the original.</p></p><h2>Basic Writings of Kant (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p><b>Introduction by Allen W.

In this thought-provoking and original book, George Saliba argues that, contrary to the generally accepted view, the foundations of Islamic scientific thought were laid well before Greek sources were formally translated into Arabic in the ninth century. Drawing on an account by the tenth-century intellectual historian Ibn al-Naidm that is ignored by most modern scholars, Saliba suggests that early translations from mainly Persian and Greek sources outlining elementary scientific ideas for the use of government departments were the impetus for the development of the Islamic scientific tradition. He argues further that there was an organic relationship between the Islamic scientific thought that developed in the later centuries and the science that came into being in Europe during the Renaissance.</p><p>Saliba outlines the conventional accounts of Islamic science, then discusses their shortcomings and proposes an alternate narrative. Using astronomy as a template for tracing the progress of science in Islamic civilization, Saliba demonstrates the originality of Islamic scientific thought. He details the innovations (including new mathematical tools) made by the Islamic astronomers from the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries, and offers evidence that Copernicus could have known of and drawn on their work. Rather than viewing the rise and fall of Islamic science from the often-narrated perspectives of politics and religion, Saliba focuses on the scientific production itself and the complex social, economic, and intellectual conditions that made it possible.</p></p><p>George Saliba is Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies in the Department of Middle East and Asian Studies at Columbia University. He is the author or editor of six other books in Arabic and English.<p>George Saliba has for more than thirty years written some of the most original and advanced studies of the sciences in Arabic. In this remarkable book, which he calls a historiographic essay, he addresses the question of the origin of Islamic science, using accounts of early Islamic scholars to show the essential roles of government bureaucracies; the great enlargement of Greek science, particularly astronomy, in the Islamic world; and new evidence for the paths of transmission of Arabic science to Europe, shown most clearly in the work of Copernicus. Finally, Saliba considers the so-called decline of Arabic science, showing that well into the fifteenth and even sixteenth centuries there was no decline, but rather that the sciences of Europe left behind the more traditional sciences, not only of Islamic civilization, but of the entire world. This is an essential book for understanding the place of science in the world of Islam and its fundamental importance to the development of modern science in the Western world.</p>&#x2015;<b>N. M. Swerdlow</b>, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, The University of Chicago<br><br><p>Saliba's book is essential reading for those who wish to understand the remarkable phenomenon of the 'rise' and 'fall' of the Islamic scientific tradition. His analysis takes place against the backdrop of the broader question of what produces scientific activity in a society, what sustains it and enables it to flourish. Saliba's singular achievement derives as much from the stimulating questions he raises as from his provocative answers. His iconoclastic views will fuel scholarly debates for decades to come.</p>&#x2015;<b>Gul A.

Long overshadowed by the stunning American victory at Saratoga, the complex British campaign that defeated George Washington&#x2019;s colonial army and led to the capture of the capital city of Philadelphia was one of the most important military events of the war. Michael C. Harris&#x2019;s impressive Brandywine: A Military History of the Battle that Lost Philadelphia but Saved America, September 11, 1777, is the first full-length study of this pivotal engagement in many years.<br><br>General Sir William Howe launched his campaign in late July 1777, when he loaded his army of 16,500 British and Hessian soldiers aboard a 265-ship armada in New York and set sail. Six difficult weeks later Howe&#x2019;s expedition landed near Elkton, Maryland, and moved north into Pennsylvania. Washington&#x2019;s rebel army harassed Howe&#x2019;s men at several locations including a minor but violent skirmish at Cooch&#x2019;s Bridge in Delaware on September 3. Another week of hit-and-run tactics followed until Howe was within three miles of Chads&#x2019;s Ford on Brandywine Creek, behind which Washington had posted his army in strategic blocking positions along a six-mile front. The young colonial capital of Philadelphia was just 25 miles farther east.<br>Obscured by darkness and a heavy morning fog, General Howe initiated his plan of attack at 5:00 a.m. on September 11, pushing against the American center at Chads&#x2019;s Ford with part of his army while the bulk of his command swung around Washington&#x2019;s exposed right flank to deliver his coup de main, destroy the colonials, and march on Philadelphia. Warned of Howe&#x2019;s flanking attack just in time, American generals turned their divisions to face the threat. The bitter fighting on Birmingham Hill drove the Americans from the field, but their heroic defensive stand saved Washington&#x2019;s army from destruction and proved that the nascent Continental foot soldiers could stand toe-to-toe with their foe. Although fighting would follow, Philadelphia fell to Howe&#x2019;s legions on September 26.<br><br>Harris&#x2019;s Brandywine is the first complete study to merge the strategic, political, and tactical history of this complex operation and important set-piece battle into a single compelling account. More than a decade in the making, his sweeping prose relies almost exclusively upon original archival research and his personal knowledge of the terrain. Enhanced with original maps, illustrations, and modern photos, and told largely through the words of those who fought there, Brandywine will take its place as one of the most important military studies of the American Revolution ever written."</p><p>Michael C. Harris is a graduate of the University of Mary Washington and the American Military University. He has worked for the National Park Service in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Fort Mott State Park in New Jersey, and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission at Brandywine Battlefield. He has conducted tours and staff rides of many east coast battlefields. Michael is certified in secondary education and currently teaches in the Philadelphia region. He lives in Pennsylvania with his wife Michelle and son Nathanael.&#x201c;The Battle of Brandywine was a pivotal episode in the Revolutionary War. However, despite its importance, little has been written about this complex campaign. Michael Harris has filled the void with an impressive interpretation of the battle. His Brandywine:<br>A Military History is a significant addition to the literature of the American Revolution.&#x201d; (Arthur S. Lefkowitz, author of Benedict Arnold&#x2019;s Army)<br><br>&#x201c;With the publication of this book, we finally have a thorough, accurate, and well-balanced study of Brandywine, including the early stages of the campaign and the battle itself. The use of original sources and narratives puts readers in the heart of the action, right along with the leaders, the common soldiers, and the local civilians. With this carefully researched and engagingly written chronicle, Harris contributes much to our knowledge of the critical Philadelphia Campaign.&#x201d; (Bill Welsch, President of the American Revolution Round Table of Richmond and Co-Founder of the Congress of American Revolution Round Tables)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a great read. Having worked for years at Brandywine, the author&#x2019;s credentials make this book the definitive source of the battle.&#x201d; (Rich Rosenthal, secretary and one of the founders of the North Jersey American Revolution Round Table)<br><br>"Besides a thorough account of the fighting, Harris does a brilliant job busting myths associated with the battle and refereeing disagreements between other authors" (<i>The Journal of America&#x2019;s Military Past</i>)</p><h2>Applied Calculus: For Business, Economics, and the Social and Life Sciences, 11th Expanded Edition</h2><p><i> Applied Calculus for Business, Economics, and the Social and Life Sciences, Expanded Edition </i> provides a sound, intuitive understanding of the basic concepts students need as they pursue careers in business, economics, and the life and social sciences.

Hoffmann November 2011 I consider myself to be a writer and expositor as well as a mathematician, and these traits led to the original version of this text published in 1975. Before assuming my current position as a Senior Investment Management Consultant with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, I was a tenured professor of mathematics at Claremont McKenna College, where, on three occasions, I was honored to be the recipient of the Huntoon Award for Excellence in Teaching, a &#x201c;best-teacher&#x201d; award determined by a vote of the students.

I am an avid (but average) tennis player, am addicted to the Sunday Puzzle on NPR, and have been trying for several years to become fluent in Italian. Long ago, I received by BA in mathematics from Brown University and my Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin.<br><br>After receiving my undergraduate degree at Harvey Mudd College and my PhD from Caltech, I joined the Mathematics Department at Claremont McKenna College, where I have continued to teach, specializing in calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. I love to write, and in addition to this text have written published texts on engineering calculus and linear algebra.

We also raise foster kittens for a local shelter until they are ready to be adopted, and yes, three of our cats are fosters that we could not resist adopting ourselves.<br><br>I was born and raised in Cleveland, and started college at Bowling Green State University in 1984 majoring in creative writing. Eleven years later, I walked across the graduation stage to receive a PhD in math, a strange journey indeed. After two years at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, I came home to Ohio, accepting a tenure-track job at the Hamilton campus of Miami University. I&#x2019;ve won a number of teaching awards in my career, and while maintaining an active teaching schedule, I now spend an inordinate amount of time writing textbooks and course materials. I&#x2019;ve written or co-authored either seven or twelve textbooks, depending on how you count them, as well as several solutions manuals and interactive CD-ROMS. After many years as developmental math coordinator at Miami Hamilton, I share the frustration that goes along with low pass rates in the developmental math curriculum. Far too many students end up on the classic Jetson&#x2019;s-style treadmill, with the abstract nature of the traditional algebra curriculum keeping them from reaching their goals. Like so many instructors across the country, I believe the time is right to move beyond the one-size-fits-all curriculum that treats students the same whether they hope to be an engineer or a pastry chef. &#x201c;Because we&#x2019;ve always done it that way&#x201d; is NOT a good reason to maintain the status quo in our curriculum. Let&#x2019;s work together to devise alternate pathways that help students to learn more and learn better while hastening their trip into credit-bearing math courses. Since my book (Math in Our World) is written for the Liberal Arts Math and Quantitative Literacy market, I think I&#x2019;m in the right place at the right time to make a difference in the new and exciting pathways course. I&#x2019;m in a very happy place right now: my love of teaching meshes perfectly with my childhood dream of writing. (Don&#x2019;t tell my publisher this &#x2013; they think I spend 20 hours a day working on textbooks &#x2013; but I&#x2019;m working on my first novel in the limited spare time that I have.) I&#x2019;m also a former coordinator of Ohio Project NExT, as I believe very strongly in helping young college instructors focus on high-quality teaching as a primary career goal. I live in Fairfield, Ohio with my lovely wife Cat and fuzzy dogs Macleod and Tessa.

In fact, I have actually used the book&#x2019;s table of contents as a part of the course outline for a several courses. I look forward to making use of the 14th edition.</p> <p></p> <p>-Ben A. Fuller, Circuit Judge, 19th Judicial Circuit of AL, Law, Troy University and Faulkner University</p><i> <p></p> </i><p><i>Constitutional Law for Criminal Justice </i>is written with the student in mind. Whether delivering class for an entry-level criminal justice student or a veteran law student, this text breaks down the many complex issues in constitutional law and makes them more understandable from a legal standpoint. Utilizing examples from case law and applicable situations, the text allows students to understand these concepts with little explanation. I highly recommend this textbook for any level course on constitutional law.</p> <p></p> <p>-Colin McCaughey, Administration of Justice, Irvine Valley College</p></p><h2>Simple Living: The Path to Joy and Freedom</h2><p><p>Jose Hobday, a Native American and a Sister of St. Francis sees simple living as a way of life - an inner stance, an attitude, a disposition, and it is this message which she conveys in this book.</p></p><p>Hobday, a Native American and a Franciscan Sister, describes her book as a "program for simple living." Her program focuses on six areas of life in which material desires threaten to crowd out spiritual life: food, clothing, shelter, work, transportation and recreation. Hobday applies four distinctions to each area: what we actually need; what will be helpful in our daily lives; what we might prefer to have; and what we must count as luxury. The result is a series of succinct chapters introducing readers to the notion that simplifying life is the key to physical and spiritual freedom. The book is not just a plan for reducing life's clutter, however; Hobday's real purpose is clearly devotional. "We can't saturate ourselves with what other people need for basics and still be living a gospel life," she warns. She explains that "simplicity is natural preparation for prayer.... It creates an inner awareness of gratitude for the material and spiritual gifts you have. It creates time and space for prayer." The brevity of the chapters, their devotional tone and Hobday's accessible style make this an ideal introduction to the concept of spiritual simplicity. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc."The brevity of the chapters, their devotional tone, and Hobday's accessible style, make this an ideal introduction to the concept of spiritual simplicity." &#x2014;Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Through Women&#39;s Eyes: An American History with Documents: Combined Version (2nd Edition)</h2><p><br>Now available in two-volume splits as well as the combined version. <p></p><i></i><p></p>Through Women&#x2019;s Eyes: An American History was the first textbook in U.S. women&#x2019;s history to present an inclusive narrative within the context of the central developments of U.S. history and to integrate written and visual primary sources into each chapter. The result, according to authors Ellen Carol DuBois and Lynn Dumenil, was to "reveal the relationship between secondary and original sources, to show history as a dynamic process of investigation and interpretation rather than a set body of facts and figures." The enormous success of the first edition confirms that the field of U.S. women&#x2019;s history was ready for a ground-breaking textbook that focuses on women from a broad range of ethnicities, classes, religions, and regions and that helps students understand how women and women&#x2019;s history are an integral part of U.S. history.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Click here to read about packaging with the Women and Social Movements Database!<br></p><p><br><br>ELLEN CAROL DUBOIS is Professor of History at the University of California at Los Angeles.

The account of modernism presented here challenges the vaunted principle of "vision itself." And it is a very different story than we have ever read, not only because its insurgent plot and characters rise from below the calm surface of the known and law-like field of modernist painting, but because the voice is unlike anything we have heard before. Just as the artists of the optical unconscious assaulted the idea of autonomy and visual mastery, Rosalind Krauss abandons the historian's voice of objective detachment and forges a new style of writing in this book: art history that insinuates diary and art theory, and that has the gait and tone of fiction.</p><p><i>The Optical Unconscious</i> will be deeply vexing to modernism's standard-bearers, and to readers who have accepted the foundational principles on which their aesthetic is based. Krauss also gives us the story that Alfred Barr, Meyer Shapiro, and Clement Greenberg repressed, the story of a small, disparate group of artists who defied modernism's most cherished self-descriptions, giving rise to an unruly, disruptive force that persistently haunted the field of modernism from the 1920s to the 1950s and continues to disrupt it today.</p><p>In order to understand why modernism had to repress the optical unconscious, Krauss eavesdrops on Roger Fry in the salons of Bloomsbury, and spies on the toddler John Ruskin as he amuses himself with the patterns of a rug; we find her in the living room of Clement Greenberg as he complains about "smart Jewish girls with their typewriters" in the 1960s, and in colloquy with Michael Fried about Frank Stella's love of baseball. Along the way, there are also narrative encounters with Freud, Jacques Lacan, Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois, Gilles Deleuze, and Jean-Fran�ois Lyotard.</p><p>To embody this optical unconscious, Krauss turns to the pages of Max Ernst's collage novels, to Marcel Duchamp's hypnotic <i>Rotoreliefs</i>, to Eva Hesse's luminous sculptures, and to Cy Twombly's, Andy Warhol's, and Robert Morris's scandalous decoding of Jackson Pollock's drip pictures as "Anti-Form." These artists introduced a new set of values into the field of twentieth-century art, offering ready-made images of obsessional fantasy in place of modernism's intentionality and unexamined compulsions.</p></p><p>Rosalind E.

Her study focuces on headhunting, a practice that remained active among the Ilongots until at least 1972. Indigenous notions of &#39;knowledge&#39; and &#39;passion&#39; are crucial to the Ilongots&#39; perceptions of their own social practices of headhunting, oratory, marriage, and the organization of subsistence labour. In explaining the significance of these key ideas, Professor Rosaldo examines what she considers to be the most important dimensions of Ilongot social relationships: the contrasts between men and women and between accomplished married men and bachelor youths. By defining &#39;knowledge&#39; and &#39;passion&#39; in the context of their social and affective significance, the author demonstrates the place of headhunting in historical and political processes, and shows the relation between headhunting and indigenous concepts of curing, reproduction, and health. Theoretically oriented toward interpretive of symbolic ethnography, this book clarifies some of the ways in which the study of a language - both vocabulary and patterns of usage - is a study of a culture; the process of translation is presented as a method of cultural interpretation. Professor Rosaldo argues that an appreciation of the Ilongots&#39; specific notions of &#39;the self&#39; and the emotional concepts associated with headhunting can illuminate central aspects of the group&#39;s social life.</p><p>An ethnographic interpretation of the life of the Ilongots, a group of 3,500 hunters and horticulturists in Northern Luzon, Philippines, analyzes their social life with reference to their emotional development throughout the life cycle.</p><h2>Black Wealth/ White Wealth: A New Perspective on Racial Inequality</h2><p><em>Black Wealth/White Wealth</em> demonstrates how an analysis of private wealth uncovers a revealing story about race in America. An examination of how assets are created, expanded and preserved reveals a deep economic divide between blacks and whites. Charting the changing structure of inequality over many generations, the authors examine how and why many blacks have had difficulty accumulating wealth and opportunities for a better life. In combining quantitative data from over 12,000 households and interviews with a range of black and white families, the racial face of wealth in America is measured and conceptualized.</p><p><strong>Melvin L.

David Schwartz examines the roles of both informal communities and sectarian communities for examples and practical techniques that can be applied to the reader's situation. The beautifully written, touching accounts of individual lives swept under the carpet of the social services system make it impossible to read this book without being affected by the stories&#x2014;such as <i>the boy who was afraid of white,</i><i>Nancy</i> who moved to an apartment after forty years in a nursing home, and <i>everyday life in a small east coast town</i> whose inhabitants help one another in times of need.Schwartz does not advocate the overthrow or dismantling of the social services, but instead proposes supplemental responses that will lead to richer, better lives for both the recipient and the caregiving individual and community. The practical, easily encouraged methods of building informal models suggested by the author grow out of both his own practice and his informed experiences as director of a state social services agency and are grounded in the basic desires for nurturing, belonging, and a sense of community. <i>Who Cares?</i> will appeal to those working in the field of social services as well as the general reader searching for ways to bring meaning into the modern, disconnected life.</p><p>Who Cares? emphasizes finding humane responses to developmentally and physically disabled individuals that are community driven rather than solely reliant on problem-solution oriented social service organizations.

The volume is magisterial in scope, encompassing the history of theatrical dance from 1900 through 2000. Beginning with turn-of-the-century dancer-choreographers like Loie Fuller, Isadora Duncan, Michel Fokine, and a bit later Vaslav Nijinsky, and proceeding through the profusion of dance styles performed today, the book provides an unparalleled view of dance in performance as it changed and grew in the twentieth century. Nancy Reynolds and Malcolm McCormick set dance in broader cultural and historical contexts, examine specific dance works, and explore the contributions of outstanding choreographers, performers, visual artists, impresarios, composers, critics, and other figures. They discuss the breakaway barefoot dance of the early 1900s and demonstrate its links with later forms and styles. With unusual detail, fascinating illustrations, and wide-ranging insights, this book is an indispensable guide to the transformations in the dance scene of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>&#34;There is simply no other history of twentieth-century dance that is as detailed, comprehensive, and readable as No Fixed Points.

So much of what people today accept as ancient Irish history&#x2014;Celtic invaders from Europe turning Ireland into a Celtic nation; St. Patrick driving the snakes from Ireland and converting its people to Christianity&#x2014;is myth and legend with little basis in reality. The truth is more interesting. The Irish, as the authors show, are not even Celtic in an archaeological sense. And there were plenty of bishops in Ireland before a British missionary called Patrick arrived. But In Search of Ancient Ireland is not simply the story of events from long ago. Across Ireland today are festivals, places, and folk customs that provide a tangible link to events thousands of years past. The authors visit and describe many of these places and festivals, talking to a wide variety of historians, scholars, poets, and storytellers in the very settings where history happened. Thus the book is also a journey on the ground to uncover ten thousand years of Irish identity. In Search of Ancient Ireland is the official companion to the three-part PBS documentary series.

It also provides coverage of neural network applications in a variety of problems of both theoretical and practical interest.</p><p>This book comprehensively discusses the neural network models from a statistical mechanics perspective. It starts with one of the most influential developments in the theory of neural networks: Hopfield's analysis of networks with symmetric connections using the spin system approach and using the notion of an energy function from physics. <i>Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation</i> uses these powerful tools to analyze neural networks as associative memory stores and solvers of optimization problems. A detailed analysis of multi-layer networks and recurrent networks follow. The book ends with chapters on unsupervised learning and a formal treatment of the relationship between statistical mechanics and neural networks. Little information is provided about applications and implementations, and the treatment of the material reflects the background of the authors as physicists. However the book is essential for a solid understanding of the computational potential of neural networks. <i>Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation</i> assumes that the reader is familiar with undergraduate level mathematics, but does not have any background in physics. All of the necessary tools are introduced in the book.This book is a comprehensive introduction to the neural network models currently under intensive study for computational applications. It is a detailed, logically-developed treatment that covers the theory and uses of collective computational networks, including associative memory, feed forward networks, and unsupervised learning.

Mysteries remain, but we have come a long way since the sketches and diagrams of the first anatomists in Ancient Greece.</p><p>Now updated and expanded to include more information than before, <i>The Complete Human Body, 2nd Edition</i> explores the body's forms and functions in greater depth than any other popular reference, from muscle structure and activity to motor pathways within the brain.

She writes a regular science column for <i>The Observer</i> in London. She lives in Bristol, England, with her husband and two children.</p>Gr 9 Up&#x2013;Incorporating hundreds of stunning images and a clearly written text, Roberts's hefty volume begins with an overview of the body covering such topics as human evolution, the human genetic formula, the cell, and body composition. It then moves on to systems, devoting most of its pages to an atlas of human anatomy. Starting from the head and neck and ending at the lower leg and foot, this section illustrates seven regions of the body, primarily employing computer-generated illustrations, but also incorporating cutaway diagrams and clear photos and microscopic and x-ray images. For each designated section of the body, double-page renderings of the skeletal, muscular, nervous, cardiovascular, and lymphatic and immune systems are presented, each clearly introduced and extensively labeled. The extraordinary detail of these pictures will give students an excellent understanding of the body's structure and organization, depicting, layer by layer, the organs that are normally &#x201c;packed closely together and nestled into cavities, with nerves and vessels twisting around....&#x201d; Other sections focus on &#x201c;How the Body Works,&#x201d; &#x201c;Life Cycle,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Diseases and Disorders,&#x201d; offering the same graphic detail.

All contributors are biblical scholars who not only think seriously about the texts covered in their individual chapters, but have committed their lives to teaching and living the truths therein.<br><br>This volume walks through the sections of the Bible, gleaning insights from each biblical writer. Every chapter analyzes the original setting of the writing, extrapolates the leadership principles in the text, and provides advice on applying that theology of leadership. Presented in everyday language understandable to both professionals and practitioners, these lessons will equip current and upcoming leaders to make a Christlike impact.</p><p>The saying is true: "Everything rises and falls on leadership."&nbsp;This is true for government, businesses, organizations and it's true forchurches. &nbsp;Never has there been more of a need for godly and bold leadershipin our pulpits than today. This is why I'm grateful for this new work <i>BiblicalLeadership: Theology for the Everyday Leader. &nbsp;</i>While many people arewriting on the subject of leadership, very few are offering principles andexamples of leadership from a biblical point of view. This book strikes a greatbalance between helping readers understand the theological foundations ofbiblical leadership as well as giving practical wisdom and insight for leadingin today's culture. &nbsp;Every pastor willbenefit from having this resource in his personal library.<br>-- <b>Jack Graham,</b><i>Pastor, Prestonwood Baptist Church </i><br>&nbsp;<br>Finally a book on leadership that takes the biblicalrevelation seriously. The authors do not start with a format or set ofprinciples and then plug in biblical texts; they first start with the biblicalrevelation and discern leadership principles. Naturally this book will not be a'how to' book on leadership or provide wise pastoral lessons on leading God'speople; instead the reader will be exposed to the biblical text and in turnbiblical truths as foundations for leaders. If you are looking for a quick resourcefor leadership principles this is not the book for you. If you want to knowwhat the counsel of God's word says about leadership then you will find valuein this book.<br>-- <b>Steven M.Ortiz, </b><i>Director, Charles D.

Kruse,</b><i>Senior Lecturer in New Testament,Melbourne School of Theology</i>In essence this fascinating book is a fairlycomprehensive biblical theology of leadership. With a stellar contributorlineup of outstanding OT and NT scholars, this book is arguably the mosttext-driven and thus truly biblically based book on "biblical leadership" thatis in print. Covering both the Old Testament and the New Testament, and movingfrom biblical exegesis to practical application for leaders today, each of the33 chapters, along with the epilogue, adds a helpful dimension of what truebiblical leadership looks like and how it plays out in life today. I highlyrecommend it!<br>-- <b>J. DanielHays</b>, <i>Professor of Biblical Studies &amp;Dean, Pruet School of Christian Studies, Ouachita Baptist University</i><br><i></i><br>I like the sound of <i>Biblical Leadership:Theology for the Everyday Leader.</i> I'm excitedthat we have a number of younger pastors filling the pulpits of some of ourchurches-especially the larger ones. But as I listen to far too many, I don'thear much Bible, and that concerns me. Paul exhorts us to "preach the Word." Forrestand Roden have taken this charge into account in a book that focuses theleader's attention on Scripture. Just a quick search through the table ofcontents and you will recognize the names of a number of Bible scholars who arealso biblical leaders that preach, and hold up the word as being paramount intheir leadership. They model scripture for us in their leadership and that'srefreshing. The editors' point can't be missed - not only are we to preach theword, but we're to lead by the word.<br><br>-- <b>Aubrey Malphurs,</b> <i>Senior Professor of Educational Ministries,Leadership, and Pastoral Ministries, Dallas Theological Seminary</i></p><h2>Diogenes Laertius: Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Volume II, Books 6-10 (Loeb Classical Library No. 185)</h2><p><p>This rich compendium on the lives and doctrines of philosophers ranges over three centuries, from Thales to Epicurus (to whom the whole tenth book is devoted); 45 important figures are portrayed.

Unfortunately, Americans have increasingly accepted the tyrannical ideas of reduced private property rights and reduced rights to profits, and have become enamored with restrictions on personal liberty and control by government. In this latest collection of essays selected from his syndicated newspaper columns, Walter E. Williams takes on a range of controversial issues surrounding race, education, the environment, the Constitution, health care, foreign policy, and more. Skewering the self-righteous and self-important forces throughout society, he makes the case for what he calls the "the moral superiority of personal liberty and its main ingredient&#x2014;limited government." With his usual straightforward insights and honesty, Williams reveals the loss of liberty in nearly every important aspect of our lives, the massive decline in our values, and the moral tragedy that has befallen Americans today: our belief that it is acceptable for the government to forcibly use one American to serve the purposes of another.</p><p><b>Walter E.

As Ellen Wu shows, liberals argued for the acceptance of these immigrant communities into the national fold, charging that the failure of America to live in accordance with its democratic ideals endangered the country's aspirations to world leadership.</p><br><p> Weaving together myriad perspectives, Wu provides an unprecedented view of racial reform and the contradictions of national belonging in the civil rights era. She highlights the contests for power and authority within Japanese and Chinese America alongside the designs of those external to these populations, including government officials, social scientists, journalists, and others. And she demonstrates that the invention of the model minority took place in multiple arenas, such as battles over zoot suiters leaving wartime internment camps, the juvenile delinquency panic of the 1950s, Hawaii statehood, and the African American freedom movement. Together, these illuminate the impact of foreign relations on the domestic racial order and how the nation accepted Asians as legitimate citizens while continuing to perceive them as indelible outsiders.</p><br><p> By charting the emergence of the model minority stereotype, <i>The Color of Success</i> reveals that this far-reaching, politically charged process continues to have profound implications for how Americans understand race, opportunity, and nationhood.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Color of Success</i> embodies exciting developments in Asian American history. Through the lens of racial liberalism and cultural diplomacy, Ellen Wu offers a historically grounded analysis of the Asian American model minority in the contexts of domestic race politics and geopolitics, and she unveils the complexities of wartime and postwar national inclusion."<b>--Eiichiro Azuma, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><p>"Tracing the history of Japanese and Chinese American racialization, this powerful and effective book illuminates the impact of war, international relations, and domestic politics through richly detailed narratives. Ellen Wu shows that the idea of Asians as the model minority began as an academic hypothesis and became a key feature for how race in the United States was conceptualized. This is an important work."<b>--Mary L. Dudziak, author of <i>War Time: An Idea, Its History, Its Consequences</i></b></p><p>"The Asian American journey provides a crucial angle of vision for a nation whose understanding of its own history tends toward color-blind denials or the white-black binary. Through this lens, Ellen Wu has written an important analysis of mid-twentieth-century struggle and racial liberalism. <i>The Color of Success</i> is an illuminating and deeply researched book--its intellectual ambition reaches to the heart of U.S. political culture."<b>--Matthew Jacobson, Yale University</b></p><p>"With rich archival detail and illustrative accounts, <i>The Color of Success</i> offers a distinct and important contribution to the vexing question of the model minority formation of Asian Americans in the middle of the twentieth century.

His collection of stories, <i>Macauley's Thumb,</i> was co-winner of the 1993 Iowa Short Fiction Award.It's debatable whether the fact that there are now almost 800 college English departments offering ``fiction-writing majors and minors,'' a fact noted by the editors of this hefty anthology, is cause for hope or alarm. It is at any rate certain that, as the editors go on to observe, the teachers laboring in these departments have become important arbiters, for their students and thus eventually for the wider society, of what modern fiction is and should be. The selections here are of interest because they represent the taste of these teachers; some 50 of them responded to a questionnaire sent out by Williford and Martone, who hoped to identify the stories by American writers published since 1970 to which those queried returned most often as ``readers, writers, and teachers.'' The choices that Williford and Martone (both writers and professors themselves) eventually made, perhaps unsurprisingly, tend to be weighted toward younger talent: there's far more fiction from the 1980s and 90s than the 70s here. The choices, again unsurprisingly, tend to reflect the emergence of a wider variety of voices (Sherman Alexie, Junot Diaz, Sandra Cisneros), and preoccupations than were evident in the 1970s. That said, the 50 stories assembled here (by Margaret Atwood, Donald Barthelme, Ethan Canin, Louise Erdrich, Amy Hempel, Jamaica Kincaid, Rick Bass, Tim O'Brien, Annie Proulx, Melanie Rae Thon, and John Edgar Wideman, among others) certainly do offer a fair survey of styles and interests at the end of the century. While the volume is likely (as, one assumes, it was intended) to quickly find its way onto the reading lists in many of those 800 courses, it also provides a useful overview of our tastes in short fiction at the moment, as well as further evidence of the extent to which American writers are still producing fine and original work in this form. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now, faced with the new challenges of our unpredictable global business environment, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner--two of the country&#39;s premier leadership experts--have completely revised and updated their classic book. Building on the knowledge base of their previous books, the third edition of The Leadership Challenge is grounded in extensive research and based on interviews with all kinds of leaders at all levels in public and private organizations from around the world. In this edition, the authors emphasize that the fundamentals of leadership are the same today as they were in the 1980s, and as they&#39;ve probably been for centuries. In that sense, nothing&#39;s new. Leadership is not a fad. While the content of leadership has not changed, the context has-and in some cases, changed dramatically.</p><p>In the 1980s and again in the '90s, James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner published <i>The Leadership Challenge</i> to address issues they uncovered in research on ordinary people achieving "individual leadership standards of excellence." The keys they identified--model the way, inspire a shared vision, challenge the process, enable others to act, encourage the heart--have now been reexamined in the context of the post-millennium world and updated in a third edition. "What we have discovered, and rediscovered, is that leadership is not the private reserve of a few charismatic men and women," write Kouzes, chairman emeritus of the Tom Peters Company, and Posner, dean of the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University. "People make extraordinary things happen by liberating the leader within everyone." After explaining their concept and methodology, the authors detail the five essentials noted above in a pair of chapters apiece that bring clarity to their theories with case studies and recommended actions. The specificity of each (motivating through "the meaningfulness of the challenge, not the material rewards of success," for example, and being able to "accept the mistakes that result from experimentation") is enhanced by advice on sustaining the commitment and making leadership skills accessible to all. The results remain as relevant as when they were first published. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>More Than One Million People Have Discovered the Most Trusted Source on Becoming a Better Leader <p>"This book is one of the very best on the topic of leadership, offering extraordinary stories from leaders at various ages and stages of their lives. Whether you&#x2019;re now in a leadership role and want to further strengthen and hone your skills, or you simply have the desire to learn to make a difference and help guide your company&#x2013;or even friends and family members&#x2013;to higher levels of success, you&#x2019;ll benefit by reading The Leadership Challenge."<br> &#x2013;David S. Pottruck, president &amp; CEO, The Charles Schwab Corporation</p> <p>"The first edition was seminal and totally original. It became a modern classic on leadership practically overnight.

"And yet, in our memory, what character is more alive?"<br>----Widely regarded as the world's first <br>modern novel, Don Quixote chronicles the famous picaresque adventures of the noble knight-errant Don Quixote de La Mancha and his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, as they travel through sixteenth-century Spain. This Modern Library edition presents the acclaimed Samuel Putnam translation of the epic tale, complete with notes, variant readings, and an Introduction by the translator.<br>----The debt owed to Cervantes by literature is immense. From Milan Kundera: "Cervan-<br>tes is the founder of the Modern Era. . . . The novelist need answer to no one but <br>Cervantes." Lionel Trilling observed: "It can be said that all prose fiction is a variation on the theme of Don Quixote." Vladmir Nabo-kov wrote: "Don Quixote is greater today than he was in Cervantes's womb. [He] looms so wonderfully above the skyline of literature, a gaunt giant on a lean nag, that the book lives and will live through [his] sheer vitality. . . . He stands for everything that is gentle, forlorn, pure, unselfish, and gallant. The parody has become a paragon." And V. S. Pritchett observed: "Don Quixote begins as a province, turns into Spain, and ends as a universe. . . . The true spell of Cervantes is that he is a natural magician in pure story-telling."<br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-<br>dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hardbound editions of important works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurating a new program of selecting titles.

Yet, technical people are often resistant to traditional "touchy-feely" teambuilding. <p>To improve communication, performance, and morale among NASA&#x2019;s technical teams, former NASA Astrophysicist Dr. Charlie Pellerin developed the teambuilding process described in "How NASA Builds Teams"&#x2014;an approach that is proven, quantitative, and requires only a fraction of the time and resources of traditional training methods. This "4-D" process has boosted team performance in hundreds of NASA project teams, engineering teams, and management teams, including the people responsible for NASA&#x2019;s most complex systems&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;the Space Shuttle, space telescopes, robots on Mars, and the mission back to the moon. <i>How NASA Builds Teams</i> explains how the 4-D teambuilding process can be applied in any organization, and includes a fast, free on-line behavioral assessment to help your team and the individual members understand each other and measure the key driver of team performance, the social context.</p> <p>Moreover, these simple, logical processes appeal strongly to technical teams who eschew "touchy-feely" training. Pellerin applies simple, elegant principles from his physics background to the art teambuilding, such as the use of a coordinate system to analyze the characteristics of team performance into actionable elements.</p> <p>The author illustrates the teambuilding process with entertaining stories from his decade as NASA&#x2019;s Director for Astrophysics and subsequent 15 years of working closely with NASA and outside business teams.

The Maestros live in Old Lyme, CT.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3 At last, an outstanding picture book on the Statue of Liberty. Although Maestro simplifies the storyincluding only the most important people's names, for exampleshe still presents an accurate account of what happened. The exceptional drawings are visually delightfulprimarily in the blue-green range, although they are in full colorand cover most of every page. Human figuresworkers, touristsare included in many drawings, indicating the statue's tremendous scale. Further, the drawings involve viewers through the use of unusual perspectives and angles and by placing the statue in scenes of city life. One depicts Bartholdi sketching the statue in the foreground as he gazes at its future site on Bedloe's Island. Another is of cranes and cables supporting laborers as they put Lady Liberty's immense cloak in place over her steel frame. This title totally eclipses the previous picture book on the same subject, Nason's Our Statue of Liberty (Modern Curriculum, 1969). A section, "Additional Information about the Statue. . . ," includes excellent lists of dimensions, important people who helped with construction, repairs from 1980-86, a table of dates and Emma Lazarus' poem as well as other interesting facts. There is no index, but the facts section makes this book nearly as useful to middle-grade readers doing research as many of the other new titles on this topic. It still could be complemented by Mary J. Shapiro's How They Built the Statue of Liberty (Random, 1985), with Huck Scarry's remarkable drawings. A striking book.

It does this in three ways; it encourages reading of continuous texts from the start; it offers generous help with translation at every stage; and it integrates the learning of Classical Latin with an appreciation of the influence of the Latin language upon English and European culture from Antiquity to the present. The text, richly illustrated, consists at the start of carefully graded adaptations from original Classical Latin texts. The adaptations are gradually phased out until unadultered prose and verse can be read. The Grammar, Vocabulary and Exercises volume supplies all the help needed to do this, together with a range of reinforcing exercises for each section, including English into Latin for those who want it. At the end of each section, a selection of Latin epigrams, mottoes, quotations, everyday Latin, word-derivations, examples of mediaeval Latin and discussions of the influence of Latin upon English illustrate the language&#39;s impact on Western culture. Reading Latin is principally designed for university and adult beginners, and also for sixth-formers (eleventh and twelth graders in the USA). It is also ideal for those people who may have learned Latin many years ago, and wish to renew their acquaintance with the language. Its companion course, Reading Greek is one of the most widely used mature beginners&#39; courses in the world.</p><p>A bestselling Latin course designed to help mature beginners read classical Latin fluently and intelligently.

Schlesinger, a lifelong advocate of human rights, believes that this ``eruption of ethnicity'' has had many good consequences, that the belated recognition of the pluralistic character of American society has had a bracing impact on the teaching and writing of history, and that nothing is more natural than for black Americans to assert pride and claim identity. But cultural pluralism is not the issue, he says--``the issue is the teaching of bad history under whatever ethnic banner.'' When Oregon students learn that Africans visited the Americas before Columbus, or that Pythagoras and Aristotle stole their mathematics and philosophy from black scholars in Egypt, it is not only wrong, the author says, but it is the use of history as therapy. When black educators argue that black minds work in genetically distinctive ways, it is ``just another word for racism.'' The Ku Klux Klan, says Schlesinger, could not devise a curriculum more effective in handicapping and disabling black Americans. Moreover, the author sees the multiculturalism movement as attacking the very fundamentals of American democracy, finding that its underlying philosophy is that ``America is not a nation of individuals at all but a nation of groups, that ethnicity is the defining experience for most Americans.'' Schlesinger is blunt in his rebuttal: ``It may be too bad that dead white European males have played so large a role in shaping our culture. But that is the way it is.'' A refreshing, outspoken treatment of a phenomenon too often clothed in euphemism. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Hart Crane, prodigiously gifted and tragically doom-eager, was the American peer of Shelley, Rimbaud, and Lorca. Born in Garrettsville, Ohio, on July 21, 1899, Crane died at sea on April 27, 1932, an apparent suicide. A born poet, totally devoted to his art, Crane suffered his warring parents as well as long periods of a hand-to-mouth existence. He suffered also from his honesty as a homosexual poet and lover during a period in American life unsympathetic to his sexual orientation. Despite much critical misunderstanding and neglect, in his own time and in ours, Crane achieved a superb poetic style, idiosyncratic yet central to American tradition. His visionary epic, <em>The Bridge</em>, is the most ambitious and accomplished long poem since Walt Whitman's <em>Song of Myself</em>. Marc Simon's text is accepted as the most authoritative presentation of Hart Crane's work available to us. For this centennial edition, Harold Bloom, who was introduced to poetry by falling in love with Crane's work while still a child, has contributed a new introduction.</p><p>The Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, Harold Bloom (b. 1930) has been hailed as &#x201c;one of our greatest living literary critics&#x201d; (Los Angeles Times).Crane's poetry has been a touchstone for me, and remains central to a fully imaginative understanding of American literature. -- <i>Harold Bloom</i></p><h2>Critical Issues in Policing: Contemporary Readings, Seventh Edition</h2><p>The Seventh Edition of <i>Critical Issues in Policing</i> includes many new and updated contributions that offer fresh perspectives and research on the most current trends in policing.

Not only did he become the most widely read columnist in Chicago history, but his column was syndicated in more than 600 newspapers across the country. He was also the author of the classic account of city machine politics,<i>Boss</i>. Mike Royko's last column in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> appeared in March 1997, a month before his death. His memorial service was held on a sunny day in Wrigley Field.<br>An insightful, at times amusing walk through America's collective psyche and history by one of this century's most popular newspaper columnists. For nearly 35 years, Royko (Like I Was Sayin' . . ., 1984, etc.) entertained newspaper readers and alternately cajoled and aggravated bureaucrats. By the time the Chicago-based Pulitzer Prizewinning writer died in 1997, his columns were syndicated in more than 600 papers nationwide, and his ``characters'' (convenient pals, such as Slats Grobnik, who acted as literary foils) were fixtures in many Americans' lives. Here his widow and some longtime colleagues have culled 100 of Royko's best from nearly 8,000 columns. They are remarkable on many levels, not least for his ability to churn out five columns weekly (his only real break came after the death of his first wife). Royko also impresses with the breadth of his work. Sometimes he is the outraged muckraker: ``A Faceless Man's Plea'' decries the Veterans Administration for refusing to pay for plastic surgery that would enable a Vietnam veteran to chew food once more. (The VA changed its mind almost within hours of the column appearing in print.) At other times he is the voice of just-plain-folks, questioning exactly why our government is acting in a particular way. Sometimes he's just funny, as in the columns bemoaning his allegedly ugly feet. A gruff, no-holds-barred writer, Royko spoke for the many who are voiceless. Despite his success and the rise of celebrity journalists, he remained refreshingly unimpressed with himself. ``I just hope my next column is readable, doesn't bore people, he said in a 1993 interview. I don't have any grand scheme.'' Yet the continued relevance of these columns reminds us that good journalists can make a difference. A terrific compendium for those who always meant to clip and save Royko's words but didn't. (17 photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Finding himself pursued by those he perceived as the "good guys," he must run to save himself and to discover the truth. Yet when Charlie learns of a plot to assassinate a government official, he risks all to save a stranger. This first book in the series may lack cohesiveness, but it remains a compelling thriller. The first half unfolds in painstaking, if not excruciating, detail, while the second half speeds to an ending with no real resolution. Readers presumably will have to hope that the sequel will explain more fully this tightly wound mystery.

If it&#39;s been a while since you read any Edgar A. Poe (he never used &#34;Allan&#34;), you&#39;ve probably forgotten how terrific he is. And some of his best work is in his lesser-known stories, such as &#34;The Imp of the Perverse&#34; and &#34;A Descent into the Maelstrom.&#34; In short, what are you waiting for?Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809 &#x2013; October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. Poe was born in Boston, the second child of two actors. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but Poe was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man. Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time that his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with the anonymous collection of poems Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to "a Bostonian". With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. However, Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan.</p><h2>Storm Lake: A Chronicle of Change, Resilience, and Hope from a Heartland Newspaper</h2><p><b>"A reminder that even the smallest newspapers can hold the most powerful among us accountable." <i>--The New York Times Book Review<br></i></b><br> <b>&#x201c;[<i>The Storm Lake Times </i>has an] unwavering commitment to elevating the community...

It's a family habit of ours, learned early on.</p><p>My first memory is of waving good-bye to Dad on our sun-drenched lawn one Sunday morning a hundred yards north of the sparkling lake. I was two. Dad piled into a car bound for Madison, Wisconsin, where he would be a guinea pig for a potential cure for tuberculosis. The year was 1959.</p><p>Why did he leave me there? Where was he going? Would he come back?</p><p>A childhood friend of his from Whittemore, Iowa, Lloyd Roth, head of the department of pharmacology at the University of Chicago, was working on this project at the Veterans Administration hospital. Roth was also a physicist and had worked on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb.</p><p>Dad had picked up TB during World War II while stationed in Sicily with the Army Air Corps. He was a captain in charge of a supply depot at an air base; it's a wonder the planes could fly because he didn't know a screw from a screwdriver. The disease didn't fully manifest itself until after the war. When it did, more than a decade later, our family was in quarantine in Storm Lake, Iowa, a meatpacking town of about seven thousand with a small college and, yes, a lake.</p><p>There we were, Mom alone with six kids, I the youngest.</p><p>Brother Bill let loose hamsters in the basement that spread throughout the house.</p><p>Brother Jim and I painted the basement red&#x2014;including the clothes and bedding drying in the furnace room.</p><p>Brother Tom, the eldest, tore the screen doors off the Corral Drive-In theater with a beery buddy.</p><p>Brother John wanted to run away.</p><p>Sister Ann was taking care of me, after a fashion.</p><p>Mom called Dad in the hospital hoping for sympathy.

You plunge your finger in the soft black soil and expose a seed, a kernel of knowing where you are, a story, an idea, a myth of who you are, and it grows out here against all the odds. It persists against the hail that comes sideways. It preserves itself frozen in a January gale out of the northwest that makes you wonder how you ever survived. It gets flooded and scorched and comes back. No matter what you do for the next ten years, it comes back. It demands you pay heed to it, heel to it, nurture it, and hope for it. It's the land, the story, an impulse to take a rough first draft of history, a drive to divine some truth in a place that lays it bare, by asking and listening.

The renewed development of local economies would help preserve rural diversity despite the burgeoning global economy that threatens to homogenize and compromise communities all over the world.<br>From modern health care to the practice of forestry, from local focus to national resolve, Berry argues, there can never be a separation between global ecosystems and human communities - the two are intricately connected; the health and survival of one depends upon the other.<br>Another Turn of the Crank reaches to the heart of Berry's concern and vision for the future, for America and for the world.</p><p>Wendell Berry is a former professor of English at the University of Kentucky.Berry entitles his slim new book of essays with self-deflating ambivalence. Since he exhorts us again on his familiar themes--the necessity to democracy of rural communities and independent local economies; the inextricability of human from natural relationships; the importance of public property conceived and treated as <i>common wealth</i>; the bane that lies in confusing the organic with the mechanical, as in conceiving the body as a machine, the mind as a computer; etc.--he seems to think he risks appearing a repetitious crank, stubbornly trying to crank the engine of humane reform to life. He needn't have worried. He remains one of the most lucid writers on the most basic matters--growing food, living on earth, relating to other persons and creatures, the love enjoined by religion. He refuses to lapse into the furious jeremiad that the continuing decline of American agriculture as a way of living seems to mandate. Instead he is patient and sensible, hopeful that there is a loving wisdom to which humanity will turn and, as the Shaker hymn says, "come round right." <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Learning to Program with Alice (w/ CD ROM)</h2><p><p> <i>Learning to Program with Alice, 3e</i> is appropriate for all one-semester pre-CS1 and computer literacy courses, and for integration into the first weeks of many introductory CS1 courses. </p> <p>�</p> <p>Alice was designed to make programming concepts easier to teach and learn. In the Third Edition of <i>Learning to Program with Alice</i>, Alice&#x2019;s creators offer a complete full-color introduction to the interactive Alice programming environment. The authors make extensive use of program visualization to establish an easy, intuitive relationship between program constructs and the 3D graphics animation action in Alice. Students discover how Alice blends traditional problem-solving techniques with Hollywood-style storyboarding. Fundamental object-oriented programming concepts and language syntax are taught independently. Programming concepts can be taught from either an objects-first or an objects-early approach, with an optional early introduction to events. The book&#x2019;s Java-like syntax allows students to view their program code, simplifying their transitions to Java, C++, C#, or other object-oriented languages.

Crafted with the same care and insight as her award-winning novels, <i>Absence of Mind</i> challenges postmodern atheists who crusade against religion under the banner of science. In Robinson&#x2019;s view, scientific reasoning does not denote a sense of logical infallibility, as thinkers like Richard Dawkins might suggest. Instead, in its purest form, science represents a search for answers. It engages the problem of knowledge, an aspect of the mystery of consciousness, rather than providing a simple and final model of reality.</p><p>By defending the importance of individual reflection, Robinson celebrates the power and variety of human consciousness in the tradition of William James. She explores the nature of subjectivity and considers the culture in which Sigmund Freud was situated and its influence on his model of self and civilization.&nbsp;Through keen interpretations of language, emotion, science, and poetry,<i> Absence of Mind</i> restores human consciousness to its central place in the religion-science debate.</p></p><p><b>Marilynne Robinson</b> is the author of <i>Gilead</i>, winner of the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for fiction; <i>Home</i>, winner of the 2009 Orange Prize for Fiction; and <i>Housekeeping</i>, winner of the 1982 Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for first fiction.

This book has a greater density (and sophistication) of argument than many three times its length; but it is one of the most significant contributions yet to the current quarrels about faith, science and rationality."&#x2014;Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (Rowan Williams <i>Daily Telegraph</i> 2010-05-29)<br><br>"Robinson is one of the greatest Christian thinkers alive today.

This approach helps you understand not only the impact of the notions of liberty and equality, which are often associated with the American story, but also how dominant and subordinate groups have affected and been affected by the ever-shifting balance of power.</p><p>John M.

Writing to &#x201c;induce kindness, sympathy and an understanding treatment of horses,&#x201d; Sewell realistically documents the working conditions of Black Beauty, who moves down the social scale from a rural carriage horse to a delivery horse in London. Sewell makes visible and tangible the experience of animals who were often treated as if they were machines. Though she died shortly after it was published, Sewell&#x2019;s book contributed significantly to late nineteenth-century campaigns for humane treatment of horses and remains a seminal anti-cruelty text today. </p> <p> The Broadview Press edition reproduces the first edition of 1877, restoring material often abridged in other modern editions.

This edition offers an invaluable introduction to the novel and the burgeoning field of Victorian animal studies. In addition, Guest&#x2019;s excerpts of primary documents plunge readers into the physical, material, and affective conditions not only of domestic animals, but also of the authors and advocates who longed to understand and protect them.&#x201d; &#x2015; Teresa Mangum, University of Iowa </p> <p> &#x201c;Students, as well as the growing number of literary scholars working in animal studies, will benefit immensely from this edition. Guest places the novel in the context of disparate, but overlapping, discourses in Victorian England: animal rights and anti-vivisection, scientific analyses of animal emotion, industrial discourse that linked horses with machines, and the sentimental novel. By locating the novel within a complicated cultural milieu, Guest defends the work from those who might dismiss it as a didactic tale for children. Her final note tying the cruelty suffered by animals in this text with the ongoing mistreatment of animals in our culture demonstrates just how relevant Sewell&#x2019;s text remains today.&#x201d; &#x2015; Monica Flegel, Lakehead University </p></p><h2>A First Course In Probability</h2><p><p><b> </b>This introduction presents the mathematical theory of probability for readers in the fields of engineering and the sciences who possess knowledge of elementary calculus. <b></b> Presents new examples and exercises throughout.

Her major in physical education (1935-1940) introduced her to anatomy and provided a strong background in kinesiology with application to both sports and corrective therapy for the disabled. Part of this experience was her attendance at the Physical Therapy Clinic of the Los Angeles Children&#x2019;s Hospital where she began her exposure to disability. Subsequently she became a physical therapist (Walter Reed Army Hospital, 1941) which expanded her knowledge of anatomy, kinesiology, and disability.</p> <p>Although her physical therapy experience was in army hospitals during World War II, the clinical exposure was very broad (1941-1945). In addition to working with a regular flow of trauma patients, she spent two years at a center that had army programs for poliomyelitis and rheumatoid arthritis. All three clinical areas involved a great deal of informal observational gait analysis as one sought to improve the patient&#x2019;s ability to walk. During most of this time she was also an instructor at two of the Army schools of physical therapy (Hot Springs, AR and Denver, CO). There she taught anatomy, kinesiology and therapeutic exercise as well as the modalities. Both normal and disabled gait were strong elements of this program. </p> <p>After the war ended, she used her GI bill to go to medical school (UC San Francisco, 1946-1950) for the specific purpose of becoming an orthopaedic surgeon. This led her to a residency in orthopaedic surgery (UCSF, 1951-1955) during the period when poliomyelitis and reconstructive surgery were strong clinical programs. Observational gait analysis and experience in correcting disabled gait became daily practice. </p> <p>Her next move was in 1955 to join the staff of The Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center where she is currently Chief of Pathokinesiology. In 1955, poliomyelitis was the entire program. Disability of lower limbs, spine, and arms were all major concerns while bracing and reconstructive surgery received equal emphasis. Working with this program further expanded her knowledge of muscle function and gait disability. Also, her experiences in observing polio patients has exposed her to a number of different gait patterns as the type of paralysis resulting from this disease varies from patient to patient. </p> <p>Following the introduction of the Salk vaccine, polio was conquered so Dr. Perry and her colleagues redirected their attention to other types of chronic impairment. This change was the beginning of their intensive rehabilitation program for spinal cord injury, hemiplegia, arthritis, and children&#x2019;s disorders (primary muscular dystrophy, myelodysplasia, and cerebral palsy). Subsequently, amputees became a part of the program. At first the program was for general rehabilitation. Then as the patient groups became large, they formed separate clinical categories with a ward for each (1961). While continuing the polio spine surgery program, Dr. Perry also developed a stroke unit. </p> <p>Responsibility for persons disabled by a stroke forced her to expand her analysis process as the functional pathology of the hemiplegic is much more complex than that of polio. Because the standard clinical examination findings correlated poorly with the gait dysfunctions, they initiated a system of observational gait analysis. Developed in conjunction with a group of dedicated and knowledgeable physical therapists, the Rancho Los Amigos Observational Gait Analysis System became highly organized. For the first time there was a means of cataloging the multiple dysfunctions that occur with the various types of pathology. For the past 15 plus years, they have taught this program nationwide. It is this program on which the organizational background of this book is based. </p> <p>A second development was the gait laboratory (1968). Its initial purpose was to document the improvement resulting from reconstructive surgery in patients who could not be returned to normal. This system was designed to help ascertain whether or not surgery actually was the better alternative for these patients. Out of this beginning was developed a functional diagnostic system to be used for planning the reconstructive surgery of spastic patients. The emphasis of the program was, and still is, kinesiology electromyography because the primary disability of spastic patients is inappropriate muscle action (errors in timing and intensity). Footswitches were developed to define the patient&#x2019;s stride characteristics, and an electrogoniometer, that accommodated for braces, was also developed. Clinical service and research have had equal emphasis from the beginning. Another novel emphasis has been on energy cost analysis of walking. An outdoor court was designed where habitual gait could be studied (Dr. Waters spearheaded this). Today, the laboratory is fully equipped with automated motion analysis (Vicon&#x2122;) and force plates, and force sensing walking aids are being added.</p> <p>All types of disability have been studied over the years and continue to be seen as the clinical need increases (cerebral palsy, hemiplegia, spinal cord injury, post polios, arthritis, joint replacement, amputees, myelodysplasia, and muscular dystrophy). At the Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center, current gait research is related to the effect of the new &#x201c;energy storing&#x201d; prosthetic feet for amputees. </p> <p>Thus, Dr. Perry continues her lifelong dedication to the research and clinical application of gait. This publication encompasses the extensive work of Dr. Perry and her successful years as a therapist and a surgeon renowned for her expertise in human gait.</p><p><i>"This ... text from one (if not the) international expert in the field of gait analysis is all that was hoped for and more ...

Osti, using the basic system of line, shape, and form used by da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo, takes readers step-by-step through all the lessons needed in order to master this essential foundation skill. Organized progressively, the book shows readers how to replicate the underlying structure of the body using easy-to-understand scales and ratios; conceptualize the front and side views of the skeleton with basic shapes; add detail with simplified depictions of complex bones and joints; draw a muscle map of the body with volumetric form and realistic dimension; master the feet, hands, and skull to create realistic renderings of the human form; and apply a deeper knowledge of anatomy to finished drawings for more impact.</p><p><b>Roberto Osti </b>teaches human anatomy for artists at the New York Academy of Art, University of the Arts in Philadelphia, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Formally trained as a medical illustrator before becoming a fine artist, Osti has contributed his work to many science and art publications. His paintings have been exhibited in galleries in Europe and the United States."This volume is useful not only for the excellent information and guidance Osti (Univ. of the Arts, Philadelphia) provides but also for the manner in which he presents the information. His presentation of the fundamentals is simple but elegant, and the visuals, examples, and exercises harmoniously supplement the information. Readers can flip to just what they need or study the work as a whole, a flexibility that makes the book valuable as both a textbook and a reference tool. Osti's skills as an artist and instructor are abundantly clear throughout the book, and the many excellent illustrations showcase his credentials well.

D. P. Briggs. The House of the Dead is a stark account of Dostoyevsky&#39;s own experience of penal servitude in Siberia. In graphic detail he describes the suffering of the convicts their squalor and degradation, their terror and resignation, from the rampages of a psychopath to the brief serenity of Christmas Day. Amid the horror of labour in the sub-zero work camp, we hear the stories of the prisoners, and live through the freezing isolation and pain of day after day of misery. We see a young intellectual forced to live, eat and sleep with men from a background of cruelty, coarseness and brutality. The Gambler is set in a spa town with its casino and international clientèle. Alexey Ivanovitch is a young tutor in the household of a general. He is both observer and actor in the tempest which surrounds his impoverished employer, as he envies and mocks the airs and pretensions of his supposed superiors.

He wrote more than ninety books, and his works, translated into many languages, won him worldwide acclaim.Jonathan Cecil doesn&#39;t sound as young Psmith might, but rather like the aging, humorous and sly narrator who seems to lie behind every P.G. Wodehouse novel, no matter at what stage of the master&#39;s career it was written. This one was early, and the humor is more refrained than in, for example, the later Jeeves and Bertie masterpieces. Psmith ambles through employment at a bank (as Wodehouse himself did as a young man), helping his friend Mike out of one difficulty after another. Cecil is one of Wodehouse&#39;s better readers, handling both women and men with British aplomb. D.W.

Others were cool and dangerous. All were incredibly courageous. Outrageous Women of The Middle Ages took on the challenge of their world--and didn't worry about ruffling a few feathers.<br> <br> Among the outrageous women you'll meet are: <br> * Eleanor of Aquitaine--queen of France and later England, she led a group of women on the Second Crusade and created her own financial system <br> * Lady Murasaki Shikibu--besides being a wife and mother, she learned the "forbidden" language of Chinese and wrote the world's first novel <br> * Aud the Deep-Minded--a Viking wise woman and explorer who led her clan, grandchildren and all, on a risky voyage from Scotland to Iceland <br> * Hildegarde of Bingen--the German nun who, late in life, became a composer, a botanist, and founded convents <br> * Damia al-Kahina--a nomadic freedom fighter, skilled at peacemaking and war, who kept her North African homeland free</p><p>Look at the history books of the middle ages and you&#39;ll find nary a woman. But contrary to popular belief, women of the Middle Ages did not simply sit around on their tuffets, waiting for knights in shining armor. These are the stories of 15 such women who defied the conventions of the times. They include the world&#39;s first novelist, Lady Murasaki of Japan; and the Deep-Minded, the Viking woman who led her people&#39;s emigration from Ireland to Iceland; Eleanor of Aquitaine; and Hildegarde of Bingen, a healer, composer, playwright, botanist, and political/religious activist from Germany.VICKI LE�N is a writer, editor, and researcher.

However, what patients say and what doctors hear are often two vastly different things.<br><br>Patients, anxious to convey their symptoms, feel an urgency to &#x201c;make their case&#x201d; to their doctors. Doctors, under pressure to be efficient, multitask while patients speak and often miss the key elements. Add in stereotypes, unconscious bias, conflicting agendas, and fear of lawsuits and the risk of misdiagnosis and medical errors multiplies dangerously.<br><br>Though the gulf between what patients say and what doctors hear is often wide, Dr. Danielle Ofri proves that it doesn&#x2019;t have to be. Through the powerfully resonant human stories that Dr. Ofri&#x2019;s writing is renowned for, she explores the high-stakes world of doctor-patient communication that we all must navigate. Reporting on the latest research studies and interviewing scholars, doctors, and patients, Dr. Ofri reveals how better communication can lead to better health for all of us.</p><p><b>Danielle Ofri</b>, MD, PhD, is an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and has cared for patients at New York&#x2019;s Bellevue Hospital for more than two decades. She is the author of, most recently, <i>What Doctors Feel: How Emotions Affect the Practice of Medicine</i>, as well as the critically acclaimed <i>Singular Intimacies</i>, <i>Incidental Findings</i>, <i>Medicine in Translation</i>, and the e-book original volume <i>Intensive Care</i>. Writing in the <i>Guardian</i> in the spring of 2016, Andrew Solomon singled out Ofri as the only woman among an extraordinary new generation of doctor writers, saying, &#x201c;Ofri has produced four impressive books and numerous articles, all striking for their reversion to empathy, their willingness to sense not only the physical life of a patient, but also the emotional.&#x201d; She lives in New York City.&#x201c;Her revealing doctor-patient stories often make her seem like the doctor that every patient wishes they had, and she draws on patient accounts to illustrate the problems that can arise in communication between doctor and patient. This book, however, goes far beyond Ofri&#x2019;s personal experiences with patients. She delves into the relevant research on communication, citing some ingenious experiments on listening...A much-needed, convincing argument that, regarding doctor-patient communication, the stakes are very high and that what patients say is all too often not what doctors hear&#x2014;and vice versa.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Throughout the book, the author offers engaging insights supported by study results. . . . It is self-evident that a physician&#x2019;s diagnostic acumen and surgical skills make a major impact on patient&#x2019;s health. This book has convinced me that the communication skills, which reveal a physician&#x2019;s compassion, empathy, and respect, will also have a significant effect on the health outcomes of patients.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Eyenet Magazine</i><br><br>&#x201c;With disarming candor and penetrating insight, Dr. Ofri illuminates the enormous power of what might seem at first a mundane and insignificant element in the practice of medicine: communication.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Deborah Tannen, professor of linguistics at Georgetown University and author of <i>You Just Don&#x2019;t Understand</i> and <i>You&#x2019;re Wearing THAT?</i><br><br>&#x201c;With the meticulous care of Oliver Sacks and the deep humanism of Atul Gawande, Danielle Ofri has written a book about the role of communication in medicine. She presents compelling evidence that even as doctoring appears to be dominated by technology, the human, affective relationship is at the very center of responsible practice.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Andrew Solomon, author of <i>Far from the Tree</i><br><br><b>Praise for Danielle Ofri</b><br><br>&#x201c;Taut, vivid prose...She writes for a lay audience with a practiced hand.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Katie Hafner, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;A gifted storyteller.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Sarah Halzack, <i>Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;The world of patient and doctor exists in a special sacred space.

Focusing on the Oklahoma Cherokee, she examines how Cherokee identity is socially and politically constructed, and how that process is embedded in ideas of blood, color, and race. Not quite a century ago, blood degree varied among Cherokee citizens from full blood to 1/256, but today the range is far greater--from full blood to 1/2048. This trend raises questions about the symbolic significance of blood and the degree to which blood connections can stretch and still carry a sense of legitimacy. It also raises questions about how much racial blending can occur before Cherokees cease to be identified as a distinct people and what danger is posed to Cherokee sovereignty if the federal government continues to identify Cherokees and other Native Americans on a racial basis. Combining contemporary ethnography and ethnohistory, Sturm&#39;s sophisticated and insightful analysis probes the intersection of race and national identity, the process of nation formation, and the dangers in linking racial and national identities.</p><p>"<i>Blood Politics</i> offers an anthropological analysis of contemporary identity politics within the second largest Indian tribe in the United States--one that pays particular attention to the symbol of "blood." The work treats an extremely sensitive topic with originality and insight.

We refer to the beliefs that (a) in general, the survival of our society is threatened by an increasing number of unprecedented and, to date, insoluble problems; and (b) that something can be done to improve the situation. If you do not know which of these is indisputable and which questionable, you have just finished reading this book.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you do, we do not need to document in great detail assumption (a). We do want, however, to remind you of some of the problems we currently face and then to explain briefly why we have not outgrown the hope that many of them can be minimized if not eliminated through a new approach to education.<br> &nbsp;<br> One can begin almost anywhere in compiling a list of problems that, taken together and left unresolved, mean disaster for us and our children. For example, the number one health problem in the United States is mental illness: there are more Americans suffering from mental illness than from all other forms of illness combined. Of almost equal magnitude is the crime problem. It is advancing rapidly on many fronts, from delinquency among affluent adolescents to frauds perpetrated by some of our richest corporations. Another is the suicide problem. Are you aware that suicide is the second most common cause of death among adolescents? Or how about the problem of &#x201c;damaged&#x201d; children? The most common cause of infant mortality in the United States is parental beating. Still another problem concerns misinformation&#x2014;commonly referred to as &#x201c;the credibility gap&#x201d; or &#x201c;news management.&#x201d; The misinformation problem takes a variety of forms, such as lies, clich�s, and rumors, and implicates almost everybody, including the President of the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many of these problems are related to, or at least seriously affected by, the communications revolution, which, having taken us unawares, has ignited the civil-rights problem, unleashed the electronic-bugging problem, and made visible the sex problem, to say nothing of the drug problem. Then we have the problems stemming from the population explosion, which include the birth-control problem, the abortion problem, the housing problem, the parking problem, and the food and water-supply problem.<br> &nbsp;<br> You may have noticed that almost all of these problems are related to &#x201c;progress,&#x201d; a somewhat paradoxical manifestation that has also resulted in the air-pollution problem, the water-pollution problem, the garbage-disposal problem, the radioactivity problem, the megalopolis problem, the supersonic-jet-noise problem, the traffic problem, the who-am-I problem, and the what-does-it-all-mean problem.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stay one more paragraph, for we must not omit alluding to the international scene: the Bomb problem, the Vietnam problem, the Red China problem, the Cuban problem, the Middle East problem, the foreign-aid problem, the national-defense problem, and a mountain of others mostly thought of as stemming from the communist-conspiracy problem.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, there is one problem under which all of the foregoing may be subsumed. It is the &#x201c;What, if anything, can we do about these problems?&#x201d; problem, and that is exactly what this book tries to be about. This book was written because we are serious, dedicated, professional educators, which means that we are simple, romantic men who risk contributing to the mental-health problem by maintaining a belief in the improvability of the human condition through education. We are not so simple and romantic as to believe that all of the problems we have enumerated are susceptible to solution&#x2014;through education or anything else. But some can be solved, and perhaps more directly through education than any other means.<br> &nbsp;<br> School, after all, is the one institution in our society that is inflicted on everybody, and what happens in school makes a difference&#x2014;for good or ill. We use the word &#x201c;inflicted&#x201d; because we believe that the way schools are currently conducted does very little, and quite probably nothing, to enhance our chances of mutual survival; that is, to help us solve any or even some of the problems we have mentioned. One way of representing the present condition of our educational system is as follows: It is as if we are driving a multimillion dollar sports car, screaming, &#x201c;Faster! Faster!&#x201d; while peering fixedly into the rearview mirror. It is an awkward way to try to tell where we are, much less where we are going, and it has been sheer dumb luck that we have not smashed ourselves to bits&#x2014;so far. We have paid almost exclusive attention to the car, equipping it with all sorts of fantastic gadgets and an engine that will propel it at ever increasing speeds, but we seem to have forgotten where we wanted to go in it. Obviously, we are in for a helluva jolt. The question is not whether, but when.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is the thesis of this book that change&#x2014;constant, accelerating, ubiquitous&#x2014;is the most striking characteristic of the world we live in and that our educational system has not yet recognized this fact. We maintain, further, that the abilities and attitudes required to deal adequately with change are those of the highest priority and that it is not beyond our ingenuity to design school environments which can help young people to master concepts necessary to survival in a rapidly changing world. The institution we call &#x201c;school&#x201d; is what it is because we made it that way. If it is irrelevant, as Marshall McLuhan says; if it shields children from reality, as Norbert Wiener says; if it educates for obsolescence, as John Gardner says; if it does not develop intelligence, as Jerome Bruner says; if it is based on fear, as John Holt says; if it avoids the promotion of significant learnings, as Carl Rogers says; if it induces alienation, as Paul Goodman says; if it punishes creativity and independence, as Edgar Friedenberg says; if, in short, it is not doing what needs to be done, it can be changed; it must be changed. It can be changed, we believe, because there are so many wise men who, in one way or another, have offered us clear, intelligent, and new ideas to use, and as long as these ideas and the alternatives they suggest are available, there is no reason to abandon hope. We have mentioned some of these men above. We will allude to, explicate, or otherwise use the ideas of still others throughout this book. For example, Alfred Korzybski, I. A. Richards, Adelbert Ames, Earl Kelley, Alan Watts.<br> &nbsp;<br> All of these men have several things in common. They are almost all &#x201c;romantics,&#x201d; which is to say they believe that the human situation is improvable through intelligent innovation. They are all courageous and imaginative thinkers, which means they are beyond the constricting intimidation of conventional assumptions. They all have tried to deal with contemporary problems, which means they can tell the difference between an irrelevant, dead idea and a relevant, viable one. And finally, most of them are not usually thought of as educators. This last is extremely important, since it reveals another critical assumption of ours: namely, that within the &#x201c;Educational Establishment&#x201d; there are insufficient daring and vigorous ideas on which to build a new approach to education. One must look to men whose books would rarely be used, or even thought of, in education courses, and would not be listed under the subject &#x201c;Education&#x201d; in libraries.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, whatever else its shortcomings, this book will be different from most other books on education. It was not our intention to be different. It just worked out that way because there are so few men currently working as professional educators who have anything germane to say about changing our educational system to fit present realities. Almost all of them deal with qualitative problems in quantitative terms, and, in doing so, miss the point. The fact is that our present educational system is not viable and is certainly not capable of generating enough energy to lead to its own revitalization. What is needed is a kind of shock therapy with stimulation supplied by other, living sources. And this is what we try to do. For us, McLuhan&#x2019;s Understanding Media, Wiener&#x2019;s The Human Use of Human Beings, Rogers&#x2019; On Becoming a Person, Korzybski&#x2019;s Science and Sanity, even Richards&#x2019; Practical Criticism (to name a few) are such sources. In other words, they are &#x201c;education&#x201d; books, and, in our opinion, the best kind. We mean by this that these books not only present ideas that are relevant to current reality but that the ideas suggest an entirely different and more relevant conception of education than our schools have so far managed to reflect. This is an education that develops in youth a competence in applying the best available strategies for survival in a world filled with unprecedented troubles, uncertainties, and opportunities. Our task, then, is to make these strategies for survival visible and explicit in the hope that someone somewhere will act on them.<br> NEIL POSTMAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> CHARLES WEINGARTNER<br> New York, 1968<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Primates of the World: An Illustrated Guide</h2><p><p><b>The essential illustrated guide to the world's primates</b></p><p>This stunningly illustrated guide to the world's primates covers nearly 300 species, from the feather-light and solitary pygmy mouse lemurs of Madagascar&#x2015;among the smallest primates known to exist&#x2015;to the regal mountain gorillas of Africa.

(Library of America Herman Melville Edition)</h2><p><b>An unprecedented single-volume edition of one of America's greatest poets, released to celebrate his bicentennial</b><br><br>Herman Melville ranks with Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson as one of the three great American poets of the nineteenth century. Whether meditating on the bloody battlefields of the Civil War, the mysteries of faith and doubt in the Holy Land, or the strange relationship between the Maldive Shark and the pilot fish that glide before &#x201c;his Gorgonian head,&#x201d; Melville&#x2019;s verse combines precise physical detail and rich metaphysical speculation in an unorthodox style and with a compressed power uniquely his own. The fruit of decades of textual scholarship, this fourth and final volume of the Library of America Melville edition gathers for the first time in one volume all of Melville&#x2019;s poems: the four books of poetry published in his lifetime, his uncollected poems, and the poems from two projected volumes of poetry and prose left unfinished at his death.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War </i>is both a deeply philosophical work of mourning for the Civil War dead and a fascinating record of campaigns and battles and the war&#x2019;s immediate aftermath. With a cast of characters to rival <i>Moby-Dic</i>k, the epic poem <i>Clarel</i>, about a young American divinity student&#x2019;s pilgrimage to the Holy Land, plumbs the profound existential and religious questions that haunted Melville throughout his life. In two late privately issued books, the retrospective <i>John Marr and Other Sailors </i>and <i>Timoleon Etc.</i>, the aging poet returns to the nautical scenes and reading of his youth. Many of the poems in the two manuscripts left unfinished at Melville&#x2019;s death, <i>Weeds and Wildings </i>and <i>Parthenope</i>, have not been previously available in a reliable trade edition.</p><p><b>Herman Melville</b> (1819-1891) sailed as an ordinary seaman in the Pacific as a young man, turning these experiences into a series of romances that launched his literary career. By 1850 he was married, had acquired a farm near Pittsfield, Massachussetts, and was hard at work on his masterpiece <i>Moby-Dick</i>. Literary success soon faded and in 1863, during the Civil War, he moved back to New York City, where from 1866-1885 he was a deputy inspector in the Custom House. A draft of a final prose work, <i>Billy Budd, Sailor</i>, was left unfinished and unknown until its rediscovery and publication in 1924.<br><br><b>Hershel Parker</b> is the H.

Whether writing about Natalia Ginzburg, typewriters and computers, Paul L�autaud, or how to be silent in German, his essays function as a laboratory for his novels, a testing ground for ideas, readings and style. <i>Not to Read</i> also presents an alternative pantheon of Latin American literature Zambra would rather talk about Nicanor Parra than Pablo Neruda, Mario Levrero than Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez. His voice is that of a trusted friend telling you about a book or an author he s excited about, how he reads, and why he writes. A standard-bearer of his generation in Chile, with <i>Not to Read</i> Alejandro Zambra confirms he is one of the most engaging writers of our time.</p><p>When I read Zambra I feel like someone s shooting fireworks inside my head. His prose is as compact as a grain of gunpowder, but its allusions and ramifications branch out and illuminate even the most remote corners of our minds. Valeria Luiselli, author of <i>The Story of My Teeth</i> <p> There is no writer like Alejandro Zambra, no one as bold, as subtle, as funny. Daniel Alarc�n, author of <i>At Night We Walk In Circles</i> </p><p> Lost in the pages of <i>Not To Read</i>, all the loneliness of the long form writer disappears. This wise, wry collection of Zambra s musings on world literature reminds us that there is profound community in reading, writing and in being a writer beyond the machinery of publishing. In a world where the instant and new is valued and disposable, this book keeps faith through its warmth and humanity. It is a lifeline for all who love reading, and for all who write. --Preti Taneja, author of <i>We That Are Young</i></p>Alejandro Zambra is a Chilean writer, poet, and critic. His first novel BONSAI was awarded Chile&#39;s Literary Critics&#39; Award for Best Novel.

David Wise, Ph.D.,&nbsp;searched for relief for his pelvic pain for more than 20 years. After researching medical journals and performing outside-the-box self-experimentation, he found a way to resolve his symptoms. He then joined forces with Stanford urologist Dr. Rodney Anderson in the mid-1990s, and together they treated patients and did research on what is now called the Wise-Anderson Protocol.<br><br>Often incorrectly diagnosed, debilitating, and disruptive, pelvic pain is correlated with psychological distress.&nbsp;Using a holistic treatment integrating physical therapy and meditative relaxation, this book guides you through understanding your pain, why conventional treatments haven't worked, and describes the details of the physical and behavioral protocol that can help to heal the painful pelvic floor. At last, this life-changing protocol offers hope and help to lead a pain-free life.</p><p>DAVID WISE, PhD, partnered with Stanford urologist Dr. Rodney Anderson in developing the Wise-Anderson Protocol for pelvic floor related pain after he resolved his long standing condition pelvic floor pain.&nbsp; He is a psychologist in California and his research interest are in behavioral medicine and autonomic self-regulation.<br><br>RODNEY U.

If you are one of them, you may have experienced rectal, genital, or abdominal discomfort or pain, increased discomfort or pain sitting down, discomfort or pain during or after sexual activity, or urinary frequency, urgency, and hesitancy.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re reading this book, you&#x2019;ve probably gone to a doctor or many doctors who found little or no physical basis for your symptoms. Your tests came back normal. You may have been diagnosed with pelvic floor dysfunction, prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, coccydynia (tailbone pain), chronic proctalgia, proctalgia fugax, pelvic floor myalgia, piriformis syndrome, interstitial cystitis, urethral syndrome, or other related diagnoses, but found no relief. We are proposing in this book that all of these different diagnoses are essentially different names for the same problem, a problem we are calling A Headache in the Pelvis.<br><br>The amelioration or resolution to the kind of pelvic pain we treat and discuss in depth in this book has eluded the best medical minds for recorded history. Most people reading this book would not be reading it if they were able to find help within the context of conventional treatment. It is not uncommon for individuals with pelvic pain to either have it on a continual basis or to have it wax and wane for many years and to go from doctor to doctor receiving little help. To date, there is no solution to this problem offered by the best conventional medicine. Conventional or not, for the most part, there is very little that has helped pelvic floor related pain and dysfunction. The Wise-�Anderson Protocol offers real understanding and help.<br><br>Pelvic pain we describe is a condition of sore, irritated pelvic floor tissue that is never given a chance to heal. Our book offers an intimate understanding of this problem based on one of the author&#x2019;s twenty-�two-year history with it and his experience of its resolution as well as a subsequent twenty-�four years of experience of treating several thousand patients in collaboration with skilled colleagues. We discuss this understanding in detail in the next chapter. Instead of pelvic pain with related symptoms discussed in this book being the result of an infection, a trapped nerve, an autoimmune disorder, or degenerative disease, we propose that it is a psycho�physical problem. Both the physical and psychological aspects must be strongly addressed for any chance at a satisfactory resolution of symptoms.<br><br>An Intimate Look at Pelvic Pain<br><br>The major contributing factor involves a chronically knotted up, contracted pelvis&#x2014;�typically a physical response to years of worry&#x2014;�that leads to tight, irritated pelvic floor tissue, leading to a reflex response in the pelvic tissue of protective guarding that creates a self-feeding cycle that gives pelvic pain a life of its own. In what we can call pelvic pain related to pelvic floor dysfunction, sore pelvic floor tissue once established doesn&#x2019;t have a chance to heal the way other sore human tissue heals. You can think about the ongoing reflex protective guarding of irritated, sore pelvic tissue as a kind of ongoing pelvic charley horse.This chronic charley horse keeps the pelvic tissue irritated and preventing its otherwise natural healing. Ongoing pain from this sore tissue leads to protective pelvic muscle guarding, anxiety, continued dysfunctional protective guarding, and chronic painful tissue irritation.<br><br>In scientific studies, it has been documented that the Wise-�Anderson Protocol helps a majority of patients.<br><br>Dealing with these central aspects of pelvic pain is daunting in the most ideal of circumstances. With the best of treatment we can offer, resolving one&#x2019;s pelvic pain is a challenge and with some individuals beyond our ability to help. But we do help the large majority of those we treat. Indeed, the large majority of qualifying patients are helped by the program explained in this book, called the Wise-�Anderson Protocol.<br><br>How This Book Can Help You<br><br>You are holding in your hands the seventh, definitive edition of A Headache in the Pelvis. It is a streamlined edition of a book that we originally published in 2008. Since its publication, the book has been read by tens of thousands, and the feedback from readers has informed our refinements to the protocol, as has our clinical work. Some readers of our book have reported that they have significantly reduced their symptoms by reading about and then applying the methods we describe here. That being said, we cannot recommend using the methods that we describe here on oneself or others without proper supervision from someone competent in these methods. We don&#x2019;t know how a reader relates to his or her body and do not want to be responsible for actions individuals take, in relationship to themselves, that we cannot supervise and correct when necessary. Pressing on a trigger point for one individual may mean using too little pressure, for another just enough pressure, and for another bruising pressure. The process described in Extended Paradoxical Relaxation may result in a significant relaxation of tension and symptoms in one individual, yet in another individual this instruction may be wholly misinterpreted and result in tension that increases and that sours him on using this method.<br><br>Nevertheless, some readers have designed their own programs using our model and have helped themselves. They have written to us with gratitude for our road map. Others have been less successful at doing this on their own.<br><br>The basic goal of the Wise-�Anderson Protocol is to train patients to become expert in reducing or stopping their own symptoms. We have found that when treatment for pelvic pain by a professional is confined to weekly or biweekly visits without a committed self-treatment daily program of pelvic floor relaxation, stretching, and effective physical therapy self-�treatment, it tends to be a tepid intervention. The Wise-�Anderson Protocol sees the treatment of pelvic pain as an inside job.<br><br>Self-�Treatment Is the Core of Our Method<br><br>For understandable reasons relating to constraints of time in conventional treatment, training patients in self-�treatment tends to be an afterthought in most treatments of pelvic pain. Lip service is given to patient daily self-�treatment but with little time for patient training or backup. The Wise-�Anderson Protocol makes the training of the patients in doing their treatment its primary goal.<br><br>The Wise-�Anderson Protocol Is Not Easy or Quick<br><br>Most of us are resistant to changing our routine. It is our experience that taking at least two hours or more a day to do one&#x2019;s home program for at least many months is the bare minimum for our protocol to be effective. Carving out two hours or more from one&#x2019;s life bumps up against real barriers for most people. These barriers include the huge inertia of a routine shaped by the demands of work and family and a desire for downtime that often makes one feel there is no room for any other activity. Our patients tend to stick to their home practice over the long term when they see that their symptoms are improving.<br><br>In our experience, only the yearning to get out of pain and the related suffering of pelvic pain syndromes is a strong enough motivation for patients to accommodate the self-�treatment requirements we �describe.<br><br>A Road Map of Pelvic Pain Healing<br><br>The biggest contribution we have to offer is a new view of the problem of pelvic pain and a road map for its amelioration. If we have done this in writing this book, we have accomplished something important. However this book is used, we hope that the Wise-�Anderson Protocol can shine a light on the path of resolving pelvic pain.<br><br>The Different Names for Pelvic Pain: The Elephant and the Blind Men<br><br>Chronic pelvic pain goes by many names. You will find a comprehensive list in this chapter. It may be called prostatitis by a urologist or coccygodynia or pudendal nerve compression syndrome by a colorectal surgeon. Other names used to describe the same condition include chronic genital pain, prostatodynia, pudendal neuralgia essential anorectal pain, idiopathic pelvic pain, pelvic floor dysfunction, pelvic floor myalgia, levator ani syndrome, and spastic piriformis syndrome. Three specialists may give you three different diagnoses.<br><br>There&#x2019;s an old parable about ten blind men who came upon an elephant. One touched the elephant&#x2019;s leg and remarked, &#x201c;Oh, this creature is like a tree trunk.&#x201d; Another was under the stomach, pushed up, and said, &#x201c;Oh, no. This creature is like a soft ceiling.&#x201d; A third pulled the tail and said, &#x201c;No, this creature is a rope connected to a tree.&#x201d; All the blind men were right and all the blind men were wrong; their answers were incomplete because they each had access to limited information. Similarly, there&#x2019;s a lack of communication among many medical specialists; if they all spoke to each other, they would see that they are often talking about the same condition. In this book, we aspire to see the whole elephant.<br><br>The Source of Pelvic Pain Symptoms<br><br>There is a simple physical basis for chronic pelvic pain symptoms. The seemingly wide array and variability of the symptoms are simply expressions of the same underlying problem, whether you&#x2019;re a man or a woman. The Wise-�Anderson Protocol does not treat the symptoms; instead, it treats what triggers those symptoms. Our approach substantially reduces or abates symptoms in a large majority of qualifying patients who undertake our full protocol.<br><br>In this book we will use the terms a headache in the pelvis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome(s), chronic pelvic pain, pelvic pain, and CPPS synonymously to refer to all the conditions discussed.<br><br>Diagnoses You May Have Received<br><br>Men<br><br>� Prostatitis (National Institutes of Health categories)<br><br>I.

In men, nonbacterial prostatitis, for example, has routinely been confused with acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis, even though an accurate and easy method for diagnosis has been available for years. At the same time, nonbacterial prostatitis, which makes up the overwhelming number of cases of prostatitis, tends to be regarded by doctors as a kind of wastebasket diagnosis for pelvic symptoms that the doctor does not understand or know how to treat. Gross pathology, as measured by the latest medical instruments, has not been able to explain the degree of suffering caused by these disorders.<br><br>Doctors often tell patients with chronic pelvic pain syndromes that they can find little or nothing wrong with them.<br><br>What we are proposing in this book is that these conditions are rather like a headache, except that the location of the headache is in the pelvis. Hence A Headache in the Pelvis is our title. And the basis for all these conditions is chronic pelvic floor muscle irritation, triggered and perpetuated by chronic muscle tension. If chronic pelvic pain syndromes are, in fact, a headache in the pelvis, then treatment needs to be radically different from what has traditionally been followed.<br><br>A Headache in the Pelvis is the name we are giving to chronic pelvic pain syndromes where no gross pathology has been found. These syndromes often include pain and dysfunction related to urination, defecation, and sexual activity. This discomfort or pain and dysfunction occurs in both men and women. One person may experience only one symptom while another may experience all symptoms. Sometimes symptoms inexplicably vary from day to day or week to week. Symptoms vary, as do their anatomical locations, yet we propose that the trigger for these symptoms is the same and that a common effective treatment exists for all of them.<br><br>Even though many people suffer from a headache in the pelvis, most of them feel alone in their difficulty. The pelvic area is considered private and is often very difficult to talk about, even with close friends or relatives. Basically, most people want the areas of the genitals and rectum to work but don&#x2019;t want to know much about them or to have to pay any attention to them.<br><br>These areas of the body are not treated with much appreciation. This is a truth that is reflected in how we word profanities. What do we call people with whom we are angry? Usually terms related to defecation or procreation. Indeed, these are terms of denigration. In our culture, the genitals and rectum are shrouded in shame and guilt. When a pelvis becomes chronically sore and irritated, sufferers often feel alone and afraid and are reluctant to share their experience, especially as they find neither a doctor or friend who can really understrand their symptoms.<br><br>Quite simply, if you haven&#x2019;t experienced chronic pelvic floor pain and dysfunction, you don&#x2019;t understand it because you&#x2019;ve never experienced the weird kinds of symptoms that occur with it. The healing of the abused pelvis, as Steven Levine has stated eloquently, in part involves bringing the genitals and rectum &#x201c;back into the heart.&#x201d; To begin with, this means changing one&#x2019;s attitude from shame, and rejection to compassion and appreciation.<br><br>Common Symptoms in Men and Women with Pelvic Pain<br><br>Below is a list of the most common symptoms we see in the patients we have been able to help. Most experience several to many of the symptoms. Rarely do patients have all of them.<br><br>Urinary Symptoms: Frequency, Urgency, Hesitancy, Dribbling, Dysuria (Burning with Urination), Nocturia (Nighttime Urination)<br><br>Frequency and Urgency<br><br>� Urinary frequency in our patients ranges from annoying to debilitating.<br><br>� There is commonly a feeling of something always nagging in the bladder/urethra/genitals, and typically, after patients urinate, they report that they don&#x2019;t feel &#x201c;emptied&#x201d; during or after urination and are left with the feeling of having to urinate again even though there is little to urinate.<br><br>� Frequency/urgency can result in the feeling of having to be near a bathroom; sometimes one can hardly hold in the urge to urinate when it arises.

As usual, it was a trauma. At the fire station on the corner of 124 East I Street and Avalon Boulevard, the lights flickered briefly, followed by the alarm tones, and then moments later, dispatch broadcast over the loudspeaker: <i>&#x201c;Engine and rescue. A stabbing.&#x201d;</i></p><p>In the upstairs bunkroom where he&#x2019;d been resting, firefighter/paramedic Tim Hill leapt from his bed, sprinted to the fire pole, and began sliding down. The call also roused two other firefighters, who slid down immediately after Tim, and three more from the TV room downstairs, who hustled into the garage bay. And with that, Station 38 of the Los Angeles Fire Department woke to life: the lights on the apparatus floor blinked on, the station doors opened, and six firefighters could be seen stepping into rubber insulated boots, pulling up yellow turnout pants, and throwing on brush coats. The men moved with speed and precision, the result of years on the job.</p><p>And then there was me&#x2014;the paramedic intern.</p><p>I&#x2019;d just finished showering and was standing half-dressed in the upstairs locker room when the tones first went off. Before I even heard the nature of the call, I threw on a shirt, grabbed my watch, and tore down the hall. Forbidden to use the fire pole as an intern, I instead hurtled down the stairs toward the garage bay. A fall down those stairs would break my bones and knock me unconscious&#x2014;but far worse would be watching the ambulance leave without me. Just the week before, a classmate of mine who&#x2019;d been interning here on another shift had missed a call&#x2014;a double shooting at a recreation center&#x2014;and I hadn&#x2019;t seen him since. No one had said anything but I didn&#x2019;t need to ask. Miss a call during your field internship of paramedic school and you&#x2019;re gone.</p><p>In the garage bay, the fire engine pulled out and I picked up the pace, leaping down the last five steps and sprinting across the apparatus floor to the ambulance.</p><p>Tim hopped into the driver&#x2019;s seat of the ambulance and hit the ignition. Firefighter/paramedic Eddie Higgins slid into the passenger seat next to Tim, radioed to dispatch that we were en route, and grabbed the map book. Tim shifted into drive, easing his foot off the brake.</p><p>I grabbed my gear, jumped into the back of the slow-rolling ambulance, and hollered, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here!&#x201d; Settling into the captain&#x2019;s seat, I yanked my turnouts on over my shorts and buckled my seat belt. Tim pulled out onto the street and activated the emergency lights&#x2014;red and white LEDs flashing in 360 degrees. Less than three minutes had elapsed since the tones sounded and an anxious sweat had already replaced the dampness from my shower. The station doors thundered closed behind us and Rescue Ambulance 38 pulled out into the dark streets of L.A.</p><p>Tim turned left on I Street, made a right on Avalon Boulevard, and floored it. Eddie activated the siren, its loud wail rising and falling like a sea swell. In the back, I threw on my safety glasses and EMS exam gloves and scanned the dispatch information on the small computer screen to my right: <i>18 y/o male. Life status questionable. Location of assailant unknown.</i> I struggled to slow my breath and recalled the first steps of treating a pulseless stabbing victim in the field: ensure scene safety; start CPR; plug the holes; and, if a heartbeat returned, apply &#x201c;diesel therapy,&#x201d; aka haul ass to the hospital.</p><p>As the ambulance raced toward the intersection of Avalon and the Pacific Coast Highway&#x2014;a stretch home to liquor stores, weekly motels, and junkyards&#x2014;Tim blasted the air horn and Eddie cycled the siren, switching its wail to a high-pitched yelp. Some cars pulled right. Some turned left. Some slammed on their brakes and others had absolutely no frickin&#x2019; idea there was an ambulance driving Code 3 behind them.</p><p>&#x201c;Clear right!&#x201d; yelled Eddie, scanning the intersection and pointing to a pickup truck to pull over.</p><p>Tim weaved through the mess, turned right on the PCH, and hit the gas.</p><p>In most places in America, summer means family vacations, lemonade stands, and swimming lessons at the local pool. But not in Ghost Town. Here, summer means the arrival of &#x201c;shooting season,&#x201d; when tempers rise with the temperature. Gangbangers stay out later. Drink more liquor. Sell more guns, deal more drugs, and create a drastic spike in emergencies between July and September. Tonight&#x2019;s assailant could be someone from the Ghost Town Bloods, Harbor City Crips, or Westside Wilmas. Or it might be someone from the Eastside Wilmas, Ghost Town Locos, or Harbor City Rifas. For years they&#x2019;d been fighting to control Ghost Town&#x2019;s gun and narcotic trade, occasionally catching kids in their crossfire. Then again, tonight&#x2019;s assailant could also turn out to just be some girl on meth who caught her guy cheating and confronted him in the kitchen.</p><p>Tim took a left on a dark residential street and Eddie cut the siren, leaving only our emergency lights splashing red across the rows of single-story homes with barred windows and security doors. At the far end of the street, I saw Engine 38 parked beside a half dozen cop cars, illuminated by the twitchy spotlight of a police helicopter scanning the area.</p><p>I said a quick prayer for safety. Slid over to the bench seat near the back door and checked my gear. Tim navigated the ambulance past the police cars and parked in front of the engine. The door locks popped open and I jumped out to a sudden assault of sound&#x2014;cops talking, radios squawking, a police helicopter, aka &#x201c;ghetto bird,&#x201d; buzzing overhead, and my captain, Chase Turner, hurrying over with the scene &#x201c;size-up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like we have two patients and we&#x2019;re going to the second floor of that apartment building,&#x201d; he said, pointing. &#x201c;PD has cleared us to enter.&#x201d;</p><p><i>The second floor, </i>I thought, cursing my luck. Assault victims never collapsed in well-lit living rooms&#x2014;they were always in the back bedroom of some upstairs unit with a barking pit bull and no electricity, lying in a red puddle of themselves.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get moving,&#x201d; I said, pulling out the gurney.</p><p>Eddie hustled over. &#x201c;Tim&#x2019;s got the gurney. Get your gear and hurry up!&#x201d;</p><p>I grabbed the cardiac monitor and first-in bag, which had all the equipment I&#x2019;d need to save someone&#x2019;s life&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or determine death. Captain Turner and Eddie led us down a cracked sidewalk that snaked through an overgrown courtyard littered with broken toys and rusted barbecues. Relics of an innocent age. Captain Turner lit the way with a flashlight, and the rest of the firefighters from the engine fell in line behind us.</p><p>Eddie hollered to me above the roar of helicopter rotors. &#x201c;Got your ballistics vest on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought it was a stabbing,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know what we&#x2019;re walking into,&#x201d; he barked. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you learned by now the only thing dispatch is good for is the address?&#x201d;</p><p>I told Eddie I&#x2019;d be fine. &#x201c;PD&#x2019;s cleared us to enter.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie shook his head and pressed on. &#x201c;Do you feel safe?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p><i>Is it even possible to feel safe in Ghost Town after dark? </i>I thought. Of course not. But I nodded yes. By the twenty-first shift in my paramedic field internship, not failing took precedence over almost all else.</p><p>We arrived at a narrow staircase leading to the second floor and started up. There was the tap-tap sound of tactical boots on metal stairs. A feeling of being watched. Eyes peered out from between window blinds. An eerie calm.</p><p>Stillness before the storm.</p><p><i>You got this,</i> I told myself. <i>Walk in there and get it done.</i> I&#x2019;d spent the previous eight grueling months of paramedic school preparing for this moment. I was ready. Yet I also knew I was about to walk into one of the most stressful situations of my life. On a critical trauma call, you have ten minutes to get on and off scene. The goal is to arrive, treat any immediate life threats, then get patients loaded up and en route to the hospital so they can be under the surgeon&#x2019;s knife within the &#x201c;golden hour.&#x201d; And already the clock was ticking. Already we were behind the eight ball and struggling to catch up.</p><p>We reached the top of the stairs and headed for an apartment at the end of a dark hallway. The carpet was stained and smelled of puke and piss. I walked in time with Captain Turner and Eddie. Together, they had more than forty years of experience working for the Los Angeles Fire Department. Ballistics vest or no vest&#x2014;I&#x2019;d follow those guys into anything. But, as we arrived at apartment 2D, both stepped aside.</p><p>&#x201c;After you,&#x201d; said Captain Turner, motioning me ahead.</p><p>Eddie took the cardiac monitor from me. &#x201c;Run your call. We&#x2019;re right behind you.&#x201d;</p><p>I shuffled past them, knocked twice, and yelled &#x201c;Paramedics!&#x201d;</p><p>The door opened and then it came&#x2014;chaos. A stereo blasting, the propulsive, flashing images of a fifty-inch TV, and a swarm of teenagers shouting:</p><p>&#x201c;Help them!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do something!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hurry!&#x201d;</p><p>In I went, into the living room, where one teenage boy was reclined on the couch, his face wrinkled in pain, his right hand pressed against his stomach, his legs limp like a puppet with cut strings. I set down my equipment and yelled to Eddie, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s clear the room. Turn off the TV. And get some lights on!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Done!&#x201d; Eddie yelled back. &#x201c;You have a patient in the kitchen, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Another boy, about the same age, was half standing in the kitchen. I couldn&#x2019;t see his face. His legs were wobbly and his upper body was slumped over the counter for support. There was blood on the back of his shirt between his shoulder blades. I directed one of the firefighters to assess him. &#x201c;Let me know what you got.&#x201d;</p><p>I set the first-in bag down next to my patient. I knelt down and Tim crouched behind me. He&#x2019;d brought the gurney to the bottom of the apartment stairs, then hurried up after us. As my two preceptors, Tim and Eddie&#x2019;s job was to watch me run the call. Grade my every move. Analyze each word. And jump in the moment I got off track.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your plan?&#x201d; Tim asked, leaning in.</p><p>&#x201c;START triage,&#x201d; I said, grabbing my stethoscope.</p><p>START, which stands for &#x201c;simple triage and rapid treatment&#x201d; is a way of quickly and effectively determining the severity of patients&#x2019; injuries in a multiple casualty incident, or anytime the number of patients might exceed the medical resources on scene. When you&#x2019;re responsible for triage and your motor&#x2019;s revved, START teaches, remember RPM. Respirations. Perfusion. Mental status. Is the patient breathing more than thirty times per minute? Is perfusion, or blood flow, compromised&#x2014;as evidenced by no pulse at the wrist? Does the patient&#x2019;s mental status allow him or her to follow simple commands? If there is a deficit in any of these, the patient is critical&#x2014;a &#x201c;red tag&#x201d; who needs immediate lifesaving interventions and transport.</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Tim. &#x201c;Get it done!&#x201d;</p><p>By now, Captain Turner and the guys on the engine had cleared the room and the lights were on. The apartment was full of empty beer cans, playing cards, and ashtrays. The gray carpet was sprinkled with blood. I knelt down and introduced myself to the boy on the couch. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Javier,&#x201d; he said, wincing in pain and offering me his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;While I check your pulse, can you tell me what year it is?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two thousand eleven.&#x201d;</p><p>I relayed my findings to Tim. &#x201c;His airway&#x2019;s clear, but his breathing is shallow and rapid.&#x201d; I asked a firefighter to my left to put Javier on oxygen via a non-rebreather mask at 15 liters per minute and continued my assessment. I checked Javier&#x2019;s radial pulse on his wrist&#x2014;strong and rapid. His skin was pink, warm, and sweaty. Was his heart rate elevated from the pain? Or was it trying to compensate for internal blood loss?</p><p>Javier lifted his shirt. &#x201c;He stabbed me, man. He <i>stabbed</i> me!&#x201d;</p><p>I saw a single puncture wound with a slab of fatty tissue protruding on the lower right quadrant, near the appendix, small intestine, and ascending colon. I was relieved to see the bleeding was controlled but, still, it didn&#x2019;t look good.</p><p>&#x201c;Were you stabbed anywhere else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, man,&#x201d; Javier uttered. &#x201c;We were just havin&#x2019; a party and he got all crazy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want to do?&#x201d; said Tim, interjecting. &#x201c;You have two patients. Speed it up. Make decisions.&#x201d;</p><p>I told Tim there was no deficit to RPM, but I was calling Javier a red tag. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried about internal injuries. He&#x2019;s got a rapid pulse so I&#x2019;m afraid he&#x2019;s compensating and could deteriorate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or he might just be in pain,&#x201d; replied Tim. &#x201c;But better to overtriage. How long was the knife?&#x201d; he asked the patient.</p><p>Javier motioned with his hands&#x2014;about the size of a Buck knife. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t think it went all the way in.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned to one of the firefighters and asked him to get me a set of vital signs.</p><p>Suddenly Eddie yelled from across the room: &#x201c;I have a critical patient here. I need a set of ears!&#x201d;</p><p>I grabbed my stethoscope and hurried over. Eddie and Bryan, a firefighter off the engine, were kneeling next to the other boy, who now sat on a kitchen chair. His skin was pale, cool, and moist. Eddie had cut off his shirt and placed him on oxygen. Two stab wounds decorated his back: one below his right shoulder blade and a second wound a few inches below that, where Bryan was now applying a gauze dressing.</p><p>I handed Eddie my stethoscope and he quickly inserted the earbuds and placed the bell of the stethoscope on the boy&#x2019;s chest to assess breathing. The boy breathed in and out a few times, as if gathering up energy to speak. &#x201c;My&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. name&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oscar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; he whispered, speaking in short, clipped, one-word bursts.</p><p><i>Forget perfusion and mental status,</i> I thought, <i>Eddie&#x2019;s right, this guy&#x2019;s critical!</i></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got diminished lung sounds on the right,&#x201d; Eddie said, yanking off the stethoscope. &#x201c;Could be a pneumothorax.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s call for a second ambulance and get the stair chair,&#x201d; I announced.</p><p>&#x201c;Already done!&#x201d; replied Eddie. &#x201c;This guy&#x2019;s mine. I called for medical aid the moment we walked in the door,&#x201d; he told me.</p><p>Just then, another firefighter appeared with the stair chair&#x2014;a collapsible aluminum seat that allows EMS to move patients down stairs without lifting them. Bryan and I carried Oscar to the chair, fastened two seat belts across his chest, and wheeled him to the door.</p><p>Down below, two paramedics from Station 85 in nearby Harbor City appeared with their gurney.</p><p>Bryan went out into the hallway to assist with the foot section of the chair. I took the handlebars near Oscar&#x2019;s head and tilted the stair chair back to lift the front wheels and clear the doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll handle that,&#x201d; Eddie said to me, hustling over. &#x201c;Get back to your patient.&#x201d;</p><p>As he said this, the scene screeched to a halt. Had I made a mistake?</p><p>I shook it off and raced over to Javier, whose condition was improving. His skin color was better with the oxygen, and the vital signs the firefighter relayed to me were within normal limits.

But we may not always know exactly what ingredients to buy or meals to plan for the most satisfying, delicious, and healthful results. This book will show you how easy it can be: Start with fresh produce, whole grains, and lean proteins; prepare them simply; and take the time to share and enjoy them.<br><br>This old-fashioned approach to food has a modern name&#x2014;eating clean. It means making meals from scratch, whether a workday breakfast for one or a weeknight dinner for four. It means making your own snacks instead of relying on anything from a package. And it can also mean enjoying dessert (see Golden Rule 11: Maintain a Healthy Perspective, page 34)! Just as important, eating clean means focusing on every aspect of our meals&#x2014;turning away from our screens and devices and avoiding other distractions, so we can savor the process of cooking and eating.<br><br>Perhaps you&#x2019;re already eating this way, or maybe these ideas are new to you.

You&#x2019;ll find excellent recipes as well as the very latest advice from reliable professionals, including nutritionist Kathie Madonna Swift, who contributed her knowledge and expertise to this project.

This book is designed for anyone wanting to hit the reset button and gain a more rewarding, and pleasurable, approach to food.<br><br>Food plays a central role in our lives. On the most basic level, it feeds our hunger and keeps us alive. But it also functions on social and emotional levels, so to fully address nutrition you need to consider, from all angles, what you eat. Focusing on whole, unprocessed foods helps your body prevent and fight diseases and increases your energy levels. This means eating fresh fruits and vegetables, beans and other legumes, whole grains and whole-grain pasta, nuts and seeds, and modest amounts of lean proteins, including fish, eggs, chicken, and tofu. And yes, even the occasional dessert.&nbsp;<br><br>As you evaluate what you eat, you should also consider your relationship to food, in terms of how you plan your meals, how you shop, how you prepare food, and how you actually eat it. In our grab-and-go lifestyle, food can become mere fuel to get us through the day, rather than providing us an opportunity to slow down, switch gears, eliminate distractions, and relish the moment.<br><br>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br>&#x201c;Know Your Nutrients&#x201d; on page 36 lists foods that are the best sources of antioxidants and antiinfl ammatory, detoxifying, and digestive properties. Having a wellstocked pantry is an essential fi rst step, and we&#x2019;ve covered the basics&#x2014; whole grains, legumes, healthy fats, and fl avor enhancers&#x2014;in the &#x201c;Restock Your Pantry&#x201d; section starting on page 46. Then, we encourage you to clean the slate with one of the&nbsp;action plans (designed for either three days or twenty-one days) outlined on pages 62 to 69. Or you can just start cooking from the wealth of delicious recipes in the second part of this book. But before you do anything else, read the &#x201c;Golden Rules for Eating Clean&#x201d; on the following pages, and remember that the goal is a healthy, whole, wonderful appreciation of food, not deprivation.&nbsp;<br><br>ABOUT THE RECIPES <br>In keeping with widely accepted ideals of &#x201c;eating clean,&#x201d; none of the recipes in this book contains any butter, refi ned sugar, all-purpose fl our, or red meat. Honey and other natural sweeteners appear, as do whole-wheat fl our and pasta, and dairy products; full-fat dairy is the most minimally processed, but you can use reduced-fat varieties if you prefer. Look for the icons listed below on each recipe page; these are indicated by colored dots in the Action Plan menus and on the juice and smoothie recipes in the &#x201c;Reboot&#x201d; chapter.</p><h2>Frankenstein (Penguin classics)</h2><p>New. Ships Daily with Care.</p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

Offering the first brief introduction to Machiavelli's thought to appear in twenty-five years, Skinner focuses on his three major works, <em>The Prince</em>, <em>Discourses</em>, and <em>The History of Florence</em>. He discusses the influence of Roman moral thought on Machiavelli, concentrating on the extent to which Machiavelli's teachings represent a reaction against this tradition. Placing Machiavelli in the proper social and intellectual context, Skinner reveals the extraordinary originality of his attack on the prevailing moral and political assumptions of his age.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Accordingly, we address ourselves to this audience in our attempt to make the fundamentals of the subject more easily accessible to readers who have little inclination to wade through the rigors of the axiomatic approach. To accomplish this goal we have modeled the text after standard calculus books, both in level of exposition and layout, and have incorporated engineering applications throughout the text so that the mathematical methodology will appear less sterile to the reader. </p> <p> To be more specific about our mode of exposition, we begin by addressing the question most instructors ask first: To what extent is the book self contained, i.e., which results are proved and which are merely stated? Let us say that we have elected to include all the proofs that reflect the spirit of analytic function theory and to omit most of those that involve deeper results from real analysis (such as the convergence of Riemann sums for complex integrals, the Cauchy criterion for convergence, Goursat's generalization of Cauchy's theorem, or the Riemann mapping theorem). Moreover, in keeping with our philosophy of avoiding pedantics, we have shunned the ordered pairs interpretation of complex numbers and retained the more intuitive approach (grounded in algebraic field extensions). </p> <p> Cauchy's theorem is given two alternative presentations in Chapter 4. The first is based on the deformation of contours, or what is known to topologists as homotopy. We have taken some pains to make this approach understandable and transparent to the novice because it is easy to visualize and to apply in specific situations. The second treatment interprets contour integrals in terms of line integrals and invokes Green's theorem to complete the argument. These parallel developments constitute the two parts of Section 4 in Chapter 4; either one may be read, and the other omitted, without disrupting the exposition (although it should not be difficult to discern our preference, from this paragraph). </p> <p> Steady state temperature patterns in two dimensions are, in our opinion, the most familiar instances of harmonic functions, so we have principally chosen this interpretation for visualization of the theorems of analytic function theory. This application receives attention throughout the book, with special emphasis in Chapter 7 in the context of conformal mapping. There we draw the distinction between direct methods, wherein a mapping must be constructed to solve a specific problem, and indirect methods that postulate a mapping and then investigate which problems it solves. In doing so we hope to dispel the impression, given in many older books, that all applications of the technique fall in the latter category. </p> <p> In this third edition L. N. Trefethen and T. Driscoll have updated an appendix that reflects the progress made in recent years on the numerical construction of conformal mappings. A second appendix compiles a listing of some useful mappings having closed form expressions. </p> <p> Linear systems analysis is another application that recurs in the text. The basic, ideas of frequency analysis are introduced in Chapter 3 following the study of the transcendental functions; Smith charts, circuit synthesis, and stability criteria are addressed at appropriate times; and the development culminates in Chapter 8 with the exposition of the analytic-function aspects of Fourier, Mellin, Laplace, Hilbert, and z transforms, including new applications in signal processing and communications. We hope thereby that our book will continue to serve the reader as a reference resource for subsequent coursework in these areas. </p> <p><b>Features of the Third Edition</b></p> <p> Novel features of the third edition are a discussion of the Riemann sphere, adding substance to the pragmatic concept of the "point at infinity" in complex analysis; an introduction to functional iteration and the picturesque Julia sets that thereby manifest themselves in the complex plane; an early exploration of the enrichment that the complex viewpoint provides in the analysis of polynomials and rational functions; and an introductory survey of harmonic function methods for calculating equilibrium temperatures for simple geometries. Optional sections are indicated with an asterisk so that readers can select topics of special interest. Summaries and suggested readings appear at the end of each chapter. As in previous editions, the text is distinguished by its wealth of worked-out examples that illustrate the theorems, techniques, and applications of complex analysis. </p> <p> Instructors (and curious students) may benefit from a MATLAB toolbox developed by Francisco Cameras, available by Internet download from the web site </p> <p> <b>http://ee.eng.usf.edu/people/snider2.html</b> </p> <p> (click on complextools.zip). Instructions for its use are detailed in the file compman.doc. The toolbox provides graphic onscreen visualizations and animations of the algebraic manipulations of complex numbers and the common conformal maps, as well as a introductory guide for designing Joukowski airfoils. </p> <p> A downloadable .pdf file of the inevitable errata that our helpful readers report to us is also available at this site. </p> <p> The authors wish to acknowledge our mentors, Joseph L.

As women living in the seventeenth century, Glikl bas Judah Leib, Marie de l'Incarnation, and Maria Sibylla Merian, equally remarkable though very different, were not queens or noblewomen, their every move publicly noted. Rather, they were living "on the margins" in seventeenth-century Europe, North America, and South America. Yet these women--one Jewish, one Catholic, one Protestant--left behind memoirs and writings that make for a spellbinding tale and that, in Davis' deft narrative, tell us more about the life of early modern Europe than many an official history.</p><p>All these women were originally city folk. Glikl bas Judah Leib was a merchant of Hamburg and Metz whose Yiddish autobiography blends folktales with anecdotes about her two marriages, her twelve children, and her business. Marie de l'Incarnation, widowed young, became a mystic visionary among the Ursuline sisters and cofounder of the first Christian school for Amerindian women in North America. Her letters are a rich source of information about the Huron, Algonquin, Montagnais, and Iroquois peoples of Quebec. Maria Sibylla Merian, a German painter and naturalist, produced an innovative work on tropical insects based on lore she gathered from the Carib, Arawak, and African women of Suriname. Along the way she abandoned her husband to join a radical Protestant sect in the Netherlands.Drawing on Glikl's memoirs, Marie's autobiography and correspondence, and Maria's writings on entomology and botany, Davis brings these women to vibrant life. She reconstructs the divergent paths their stories took, and at the same time shows us each amid the common challenges and influences of the time--childrearing, religion, an outpouring of vernacular literature--and in relation to men.</p><p>The resulting triptych suggests the range of experience, self-consciousness, and expression possible in seventeenth-century Europe and its outposts. It also shows how persons removed from the centers of power and learning ventured in novel directions, modifying in their own way Europe's troubled and ambivalent relations with other "marginal" peoples.</p></p><p>Natalie Zemon Davis is Henry Charles Lea Professor of History, Emerita, Princeton University.&#x201c;[This] stylishly sketched seventeenth- and eighteenth-century biographical triptych is yet another exploration of how the modest in early modern Europe strove to fashion identities for themselves, but it is also more.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Arthur Quinn</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A treasure. Davis has written a scholarly...and multilayered history...Her three subjects come alive.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ruth Johnstone Wales</b><b>, </b><b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Davis's work has always reached beyond fashionable trends to communicate with a wider audience. Where feminist historians have often inveighed against writing women's history in order to supply us with heroines, Davis gives us three rounded portraits of strong early modern women with whom we are certainly encouraged to identify, and whose dilemmas are not unlike our own. Where early modern historians insist on the ubiquity of patriarchy, Davis presents us with hard-working, bread-winning women, never submerged in motherhood and never obliterated as wives...All that Davis writes springs from careful, critical consideration of the mass of theoretical writing that has recently appeared on women's writing and historical anthropology: none of it clutters her text...For Davis, the historian is a teller of stories. Her book can be read as a way of writing history which does not collar the reader with direct argument or interpretation, but which seeks instead to provoke the imagination. Davis begins with a fictitious dialogue between herself and the three women whose lives she has chronicled, an imaginative risk few scholars would care to take. This is the sort of book that lingers in the mind. In time, one realizes that what Natalie Zemon Davis has accomplished is a new way of thinking about the relations between the Old World and the New, between women and men, mothers and children; and a vast opening up of the territory of the historian.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lyndal Roper</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A marvelous book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lorna Sage</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In an extraordinary work of scholarship, Natalie Zemon Davis...has brought together within the pages of one book three 17th-century European women who lived lives of daring and accomplishment on 'the margins.' Davis sets out to demonstrate that, in their work far from the centres of power, Glikl bas Judah Leib, Marie de l'Incarnation, and Sibylla Merian were not only breaking new ground for women, but that in doing so they were in some ways morally superior to the men of their day.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Katherine Govier</b><b>, </b><b><i>Toronto Star</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the most inspired historians of early modern France has pushed out the usual borders of female blazons by choosing three women who weren't muses, mistresses or martyrs...Davis has chosen three personalities of singular gifts and appetite for self-transformation, and the strength of character to achieve it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Marina Warner</b><b>, </b><b><i>Independent on Sunday</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A deeply committed but also pleasantly discursive history of women living on the fringes of Europe's early modern culture.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robin Blake</b><b>, </b><b><i>Independent on Sunday</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Through intimate studies of three seventeenth-century women, [Natalie Zemon Davis] reconstructs histories that both fill out the conceptual frameworks of early modern women's history, and challenge them...One of the great values of Davis's work is the precision with which it tracks its subjects through the multiple domains of their lives: from convent to new frontier, from home to marketplace, from the field to the drawing board...Their lives, as reconstructed through Davis's meticulous and compelling narrative, also shed light on a whole range of social, spiritual and cultural worlds for women, marginalized from much historical narrative...It ends by unsettling the most obvious frameworks for early modern women's history--the household, the workshop, the church--and by demanding historical space for the explorations, the reflections, and the ordinary physical experiences of its subjects.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Laura Gowing</b><b>, </b><b><i>History Workshop Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Natalie Davis tells a good story, as those who have read her classic, <i>The Return of Martin Guerre</i>, will know...Here she tells <i>three</i> good stories.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Lamont</b><b>, </b><b><i>History Today</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Davis has a rare talent: she is both an accomplished historian and a capable writer.
